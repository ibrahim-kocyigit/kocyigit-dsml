## 1. Accessing Help and Getting Object Types
```python
1 + 1 # Everything after the hash symbol is ignored by Python
help(max) # Display the documentation for the max function
type('a') # Get the type of an object - this returns 'str'
```

## 2. Importing Packages
Python packages are a collection of useful tools developed by the open-source community. They extend the capabilities of the python language. To install a new package (for example, pandas), you can go to your command prompt and type in pip install pandas. Once a package is installed, you can import it as follows:
```python
import pandas # Import a package without an alias
import pandas as pd # Import a package with an alias
from pandas import DataFrame # Import an object from a package
```
