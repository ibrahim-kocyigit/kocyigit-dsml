## What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its clear syntax and readability. It's widely used in various domains, including data science, web development, and scripting.

## Variables
Variables are used to store data values.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
```

## Python Terms
* **Statement:** A line of code that performs an action.
* **Expression:** A combination of values, variables, and operators that evaluates to a single value.
* **Function:** A block of code that performs a specific task.
* **Module:** A file containing Python definitions and statements.

## Data Types
* **int:** Integer (e.g., `10`, `-5`)
* **float:** Floating-point number (e.g., `3.14`, `-2.5`)
* **str:** String (e.g., `"Hello"`, `'Python'`)
* **bool:** Boolean (`True` or `False`)
* **list:** Ordered collection of items (e.g., ``)
* **tuple:** Immutable ordered collection of items (e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`)
* **dict:** Collection of key-value pairs (e.g., `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`)
* **set:** Unordered collection of unique items (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`)

## Strings
Strings are sequences of characters.

```python
message = "Hello, world!"
```

## String Formatting
```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
```

## Operators
* **Arithmetic Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//` (floor division), `%` (modulo), `**` (exponentiation)
* **Comparison Operators:** `==` (equals), `!=` (not equals), `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
* **Logical Operators:** `and`, `or`, `not`
* **Assignment Operators:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, etc.
* **Identity Operators:** `is`, `is not`
* **Membership Operators:** `in`, `not in`

## Conditional Statements
```python
if condition:
    # Code to execute if the condition is True
elif another_condition:
    # Code to execute if another_condition is True
else:
    # Code to execute if none of the above conditions are True
```
