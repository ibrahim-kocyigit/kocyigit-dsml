    "#### What is an Area Plot?\n",
    "* An area plot (also called an area chart or area graph) is a visualization that displays the magnitude and proportion of multiple variables over a continuous axis (usually time). It's like a line plot, but the area blow is filled with color.\n",
    "* **Key Features:**\n",
    "    * Shows the cumulative magnitude of variables.\n",
    "    * Emphasizes the overall trend and the contribution of each variable to the total.\n",
    "    * Good for comparing multiple quantities over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Area Plots\n",
    "Area plots are particularly useful when:\n",
    "* You want to show the cumulative total of a quantity over time.\n",
    "* You want to compare the contributions of different categories to a total over time.\n",
    "* You want to emphasize the overall trend rather than individual data points.\n",
    "* Data has cumulative nature.\n",

    "#### What is a Histogram?\n",
    "* A histogram is a graphical representation of the _frequency distribution_ of a _numerical_ dataset. It shows how many data points fall within specific ranges (called \"bins\").\n",
    "* **How it works?**\n",
    "    * **Partitioning:** The range of the data (the difference between the minimum and maximum values) is divided into series of intervals called _bins_. These bins are usually of equal width.\n",
    "    * **Counting:** For each bin, the number of data points that fall within that bin's range is counted. This count is the _frequency_ for that bin.\n",
    "    * **Plotting:** A bar is drawn for each bin. The width represents bin size.\n",
    "* **Key Features:**\n",
    "    * **X-axis:** Represents the range of the numerical variable, divided into bins.\n",
    "    * **Y-axis:** Represents the frequency (count) or relative frequency (proportion) of data points within each bin.\n",
    "    * **Bars:** Adjacent bars (usually touching) represent the frequency of each bin.\n",
    "* **Purpose:** \n",
    "    * To visualize the distribution of a numerical variable.\n",
    "    * To show the _shape_ of the distribution (symmetrical, skewed, bimodal, etc.).\n",
    "    * To identify the _central tendency_ (where most data points are clustered).\n",

    "#### What is a Bar Chart?\n",
    "* A bar chart (also called a bar graph) is a type of plot that uses rectangular bars to represent the value of a categorical variable. The length (or height) of each bar is proportional to the value it represents.\n",
    "* **Key Features:**\n",
    "    * **X-axis (usually):** Represents the categories being compared.\n",
    "    * **Y-axis (usually):** Represents the numerical value associated with each category.\n",
    "    * **Bars:** Rectangular bars, either vertical (more common) or horizontal, representing each category. The length/height of the bar corresponds to the value.\n",
    "    * **Discrete Data:** Bar charts are best suited for _discrete_ categorical data, where the categories are distinct and separate. (Histograms, in contrast, are used for _continuous_ numerical data).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Bar Charts?\n",
    "Bar charts are excellent for:\n",
    "* **Comparing values across categories:** Showing the differences in magnitude between different groups.\n",
    "* **Displaying frequencies or counts:** Showing how many items fall into each category.\n",
    "* **Tracking changes over time (for a limited number of time points):** If you have data for a few distinct time periods, a bar chart can be used to show changes. For many time points, a line graph is usually better.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What is a Pie Chart?\n",
    "* **Definition:** A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic that represents proportions of a whole. The circle is divided into slices (like pieces of a pie), and the size of each slice is proportional to the quantity it represents.\n",
    "* **Key Features:**\n",
    "    * **Circle:** Represents the whole (100%).\n",
    "    * **Slices:** Represent parts of the whole.  The area (and central angle) of each slice is proportional to the value it represents.\n",
    "    * **Proportions:** Pie charts are best for showing *proportions* or *percentages*, not absolute values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use (and When *Not* to Use) Pie Charts\n",
    "* **Appropriate Use Cases:**\n",
    "    * Showing the composition of a *single* categorical variable with a *small* number of categories (ideally, fewer than 5-7).\n",
    "    * When you want to emphasize the relative proportions of each category to the *whole*.\n",
    "* **When to *Avoid* Pie Charts (and Why):**\n",
    "    * **Many Categories:** If you have too many categories, the slices become thin and hard to compare.  The chart becomes cluttered and difficult to read.\n",
    "    * **Comparing Values Across Categories:**  Humans are not good at judging relative areas accurately, especially in circular shapes.  It's much harder to compare the sizes of pie slices than the lengths of bars in a bar chart.\n",
    "    * **Showing Changes Over Time:** Pie charts are not suitable for showing trends over time.\n",
    "    * **Comparing Different Datasets:** Comparing multiple pie charts side-by-side is extremely difficult.\n",
    "* **Alternatives to Pie Charts:**\n",
    "    * **Bar Charts:**  Almost always a better choice for comparing categories.  They are much easier to read and interpret accurately.\n",
    "    * **Stacked Bar Charts:**  Can show proportions within categories, similar to a pie chart, but in a more readable format.\n",
