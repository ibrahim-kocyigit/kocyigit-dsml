    "A scatter plot is a type of graph that displays the relationship between *two numerical variables*.  Each data point is represented as a point on a two-dimensional plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Key Features:**\n",
    "    * **X-axis:** Represents one numerical variable (often the *independent* variable).\n",
    "    * **Y-axis:** Represents the other numerical variable (often the *dependent* variable).\n",
    "    * **Points:** Each point represents a single observation (e.g., a person, a country, a year). The position of the point is determined by its values on the x and y variables.\n",

    "### When to Use Scatter Plots\n",
    "Scatter plots are primarily used to:\n",
    "* **Identify Relationships:** Determine if there's a relationship (correlation) between two variables.  This relationship can be:\n",
    "    * **Positive Correlation:** As one variable increases, the other tends to increase (upward trend).\n",
    "    * **Negative Correlation:** As one variable increases, the other tends to decrease (downward trend).\n",
    "    * **No Correlation:** No clear relationship between the variables (points are scattered randomly).\n",
    "* **Identify Outliers:**  Find data points that deviate significantly from the general pattern.\n",
    "* **Identify Clusters:** See if the data points group together in distinct clusters.\n",
    "* **Visualize large datasets**: Scatter plots are very useful when you're dealing with large datasets."
