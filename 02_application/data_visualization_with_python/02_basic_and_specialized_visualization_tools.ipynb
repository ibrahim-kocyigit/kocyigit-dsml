    "\n",
    "#### What is an Area Plot?\n",
    "* An area plot (also called an area chart or area graph) is a visualization that displays the magnitude and proportion of multiple variables over a continuous axis (usually time). It's like a line plot, but the area blow is filled with color.\n",
    "* **Key Features:**\n",
    "    * Shows the cumulative magnitude of variables.\n",
    "    * Emphasizes the overall trend and the contribution of each variable to the total.\n",
    "    * Good for comparing multiple quantities over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Use Area Plots\n",
    "Area plots are particularly useful when:\n",
    "* You want to show the cumulative total of a quantity over time.\n",
    "* You want to compare the contributions of different categories to a total over time.\n",
    "* You want to emphasize the overall trend rather than individual data points.\n",
    "* Data has cumulative nature.\n",
    "* Visualizing population demographics.\n",
    "* Displaying the contribution of resources across various sectors.\n",
