## Python for Data Science
This section covers the fundamental programming skills in Python that are essential for any data science or machine learning practitioner. Before diving into specialized libraries, a strong grasp of core Python concepts—from data structures to functions and error handling—is crucial for writing clean, efficient, and effective code.

The lessons are structured to build from basic syntax to more advanced, practical programming concepts relevant to data-heavy tasks.
