### Data Discourse Over the Years

#### Data science vs Data analytics

| Data science | Data analytics |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| Produces broad insights that concentrate on which questions should be asked about data | Emphasizes discovering answers to questions being asked |
| Confronts what is unknown by using advanced techniques to make predictions about the future | Determines actionable insights that can be applied immediately based on existing queries |
| Seeks to answer questions like “What will happen?” and “How can we make X happen?” | Seeks to answer questions like “What happened?” and “Why did it happen?” |


* **Shared Foundation:** Data science and data analytics have the same fundamental goal: to discover insights from data that help an organization improve. They often use similar tools and work together on data teams.
* **Interchangeable Titles:** The terms "data scientist" and "data analyst" are frequently used interchangeably in the industry. The actual day-to-day responsibilities of a role depend more on the specific company, its size, and its needs, rather than just the job title.
* **Program-Specific Language:** To keep things clear, this program uses these specific terms:
    * **Data Professional:** A general term for *both* analysts and scientists.
    * **Data Career Space:** An umbrella term for the entire spectrum of jobs in the data field.
* **Context is Key:** Remember that the same job title can mean different things at different companies.
