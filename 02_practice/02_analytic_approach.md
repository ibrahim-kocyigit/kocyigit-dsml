# Stage 2: Analytic Approach

_"Once the business problem has been clearly stated, the data scientist can define the analytic approach to solving the problem. This stage entails expressing the problem in the context of statistical and machine-learning techniques, so the organization can identify the most suitable ones for the desired outcome. For example, if the goal is to predict a response such as "yes" or "no", then the analytic approach could be defined as building, testing and implementing a classification model._" - **John B. Rollings**

## Step 1: Frame the Problem Technically
Based on the business problem and objectives (from Stage 1), translate the problem into one or more potential machine learning or statistical tasks. For example, is this a classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, or time series forecasting problem? Consider multiple possible framings and transcribe your findings into the [Analytic Approach Report](./stage_reports/02_analytic_approach_report.md).
