## Stage Reports

This directory contains detailed reports documenting each stage of the data science project, following John B. Rollins's 10-Stage Foundational Methodology for Data Science (as described in [this TDWI article](https://tdwi.org/~/media/64511A895D86457E964174EDC5C4C7B1.PDF)).

Each report provides a comprehensive record of the decisions, processes, and findings for that specific stage. These reports serve as detailed documentation of the project's evolution and rationale.

The key findings, conclusions, and summaries from these stage reports will be incorporated into the main project `README.md` file to provide a high-level overview of the project. This ensures that the main `README.md` remains concise and focused on the most important information, while the detailed stage reports provide in-depth documentation for those who need it.
