# Stage 10: Feedback
_"By collecting results from the implemented model, the organization gets feedback on the modelâ€™s performance and its impact on the environment in which it was deployed. For example, feedback could take the form of response rates to a promotional campaign targeting a group of customers identified by the model as high-potential responders. Analyzing this feedback enables data scientists to refine the model to improve its accuracy and usefulness. They can automate some or all of the feedback-gathering and model assessment, refinement and redeployment steps to speed up the process of model refreshing for better outcomes."_ - **John B. Rollins**

## Step 1: Collect Performance Data
Collect data on the model's performance in the production environment. This data should be relevant to the key evaluation metrics used during model development and evaluation (Stages 7 and 8).  This could involve logging predictions, actual outcomes, and any relevant metadata.

## Step 2: Analyze Performance Data
Analyze the collected performance data to assess how well the model is performing in the real world.  Compare the performance to the baseline established during model evaluation (Stage 8) and to the business objectives (Stage 1).

## Step 3: Identify Areas for Improvement
Identify any areas where the model's performance is suboptimal or could be improved.  This could involve analyzing errors, identifying segments of the data where the model performs poorly, or detecting concept drift (changes in the relationship between input features and the target variable).

## Step 4: Develop Improvement Strategies
Develop strategies for addressing the identified areas for improvement.  This might involve:

* **Retraining the model:** Retrain the model with new data, including the collected performance data.
* **Refining features:**  Improve the feature engineering process (Stage 6) based on insights from the production data.
* **Adjusting hyperparameters:**  Re-tune the model's hyperparameters (Stage 7).
* **Collecting more data:**  If data limitations are a factor, collect more data or explore alternative data sources.
* **Re-evaluating the analytic approach:** In some cases, it may be necessary to revisit the analytic approach (Stage 2) and consider alternative modeling techniques.

## Step 5: Implement Improvements
Implement the chosen improvement strategies. This may involve iterating through previous stages of the data science methodology (e.g., data preparation, modeling, evaluation).

## Step 6: Document Feedback and Actions
Document the feedback received, the analysis of performance data, the identified areas for improvement, the chosen improvement strategies, and the results of implementing those strategies.
