### Statistics and Probability
Statistics and Probability form the bedrock for reasoning under uncertainty, which is at the heart of machine learning. Probability theory provides the framework for quantifying the likelihood of events and underlies many algorithms, while statistics gives us the tools to analyze data, draw inferences from samples, and rigorously evaluate model performance.

Concepts such as cost functions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing all stem directly from this field, allowing us to move from simply making predictions to understanding their reliability and significance.
