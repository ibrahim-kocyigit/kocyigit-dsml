    "To find the *exact* instantaneous velocity at a single point, we need to see what happens as the interval around that point gets smaller and smaller, approaching zero.\n",

    "The process we just visualized is captured formally by the concept of a **limit**. The derivative of a function `f(x)` with respect to `x` is the limit of the slope of the secant lines as the interval `h` (or `Î”t` in our example) approaches zero.\n",
