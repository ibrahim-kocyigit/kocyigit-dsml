    "A constant function is a horizontal line with the equation $f(x) = c$, where `c` is some constant.\n",

    "We can see this from the slope formula, $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}$. Since the y-value is always `c`, the change in y ($\\Delta y$) is always $c - c = 0$. Therefore, the slope is always 0.\n",

    "Now let's consider any line that is not horizontal. Its equation is $f(x) = ax + b$, where `a` is the slope and `b` is the y-intercept.\n",

    "Just like with the constant function, the tangent line to a straight line at any point is the line itself. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line is always the slope of the original line, which is `a`.\n",
