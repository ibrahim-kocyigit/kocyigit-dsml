    "Let's understand why this works. Consider the function $f(x) = x^2$ and a new function $g(x) = 2x^2$, which is just `f(x)` scaled by a factor of 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying the function by 2 has the effect of stretching the entire graph vertically by a factor of 2. Every y-value is doubled.\n",

    "    * The rise is $\\Delta y = f(2) - f(1) = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n",
    "    * The slope is $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{3}{1} = 3$.  \n",
    "` `\n",
    "* **For $g(x) = 2x^2$:**\n",
    "    * The run is still $\\Delta x = 1$.\n",
    "    * The rise is now $\\Delta y = g(2) - g(1) = 8 - 2 = 6$. Notice the rise is exactly doubled.\n",
    "    * The slope is $\\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{6}{1} = 6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we only stretched the graph vertically, the \"rise\" of any secant line is multiplied by our constant `c`, while the \"run\" stays the same. Therefore, the slope of the secant line is also multiplied by `c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we take the limit and these secant lines become tangent lines, the same relationship holds. The slope of the tangent for the scaled function will be `c` times the slope of the tangent for the original function.\n",
