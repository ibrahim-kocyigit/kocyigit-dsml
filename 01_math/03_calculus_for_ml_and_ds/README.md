# Calculus for ML & DS

This section contains my personal, detailed notes on calculus, focusing on the concepts most essential for machine learning and data science. A strong grasp of calculus is non-negotiable for understanding how models are **optimized**â€”the process by which they "learn" from data.

Concepts like **gradient descent** and the **backpropagation** algorithm, which are the engines behind modern deep learning, are direct applications of the principles of derivatives covered in this course.

## Source Material

The notes in this folder are curated from my studies of the course **"Calculus for Machine Learning and Data Science"** by **DeepLearning.AI**, taught by the excellent instructor **Luis Serrano**. This course is the second part of the broader **"Mathematics for Machine Learning and Data Science"** specialization available on Coursera.

## How to Use These Notes

My primary recommendation is to enroll in the official course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-calculus) and use these notes as a complementary resource. The best way to build deep understanding and long-term memory is through active learning.

**Suggested Workflow:**

1.  Watch a video lecture from the course.
2.  Afterward, open the corresponding Jupyter Notebook from this repository.
3.  Manually re-type the notes into your own local digital notebook or copy them by hand to a physical one. The physical act of typing/writing and engaging with the material is far more effective than just reading or copy-pasting.

### For Self-Study (Free Path)

It is possible to **audit** the course for free on Coursera, which provides access to all the lecture videos. If that is not an option, you can still use these notes as a structured learning path.

**Suggested Workflow:**

1.  Use the folder and file structure as your curriculum roadmap.
2.  For each subject, you can share the contents of the Jupyter Notebook with an AI assistant and ask it to explain the concepts in detail.
3.  Use other excellent free resources, like **Khan Academy's** videos on calculus, as a supplementary source to deepen your understanding.

> **Note on Course Materials:** My notes are based on the public lecture videos. To respect the course's copyright, this folder does **not** include any of the graded materials, such as my completed assignments or official lab documents.
