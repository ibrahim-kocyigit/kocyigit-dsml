    "The second derivative gives us a measure of the **curvature** of a function, also known as its **concavity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $f''(x) > 0$, the function is **concave up** (like a happy face ðŸ˜Š). This means the slope (the first derivative) is increasing. In our car example, this corresponds to positive acceleration.\n",
    "* If $f''(x) < 0$, the function is **concave down** (like a sad face ðŸ˜ž). This means the slope is decreasing. This corresponds to negative acceleration (deceleration).\n",
    "* If $f''(x) = 0$, the function has no curvature at that point (it's a straight line).\n",

    "## The Second Derivative Test for Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "This property is extremely useful for optimization. We already know that candidates for maxima and minima occur where the first derivative is zero ($f'(x) = 0$). The **second derivative test** helps us classify these points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a point `c` where $f'(c) = 0$.\n",
    "1.  **If $f''(c) > 0$ (concave up):** The point `c` is a **local minimum**.\n",
    "2.  **If $f''(c) < 0$ (concave down):** The point `c` is a **local maximum**.\n",
    "3.  **If $f''(c) = 0$:** The test is inconclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a powerful tool because it allows us to distinguish between the peaks and valleys of a function by simply checking the sign of the second derivative at the points where the slope is flat."
