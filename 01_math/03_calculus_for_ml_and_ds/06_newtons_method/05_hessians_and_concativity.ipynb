    "Now we can explore one of the most important applications of the Hessian matrix in optimization. Recall that for a function of one variable, the **second derivative test** helps us determine if a point with a zero-slope tangent is a local minimum or maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $f''(x) > 0$, the function is **concave up** (like a happy face ðŸ˜Š), and the point is a **local minimum**.\n",
    "* If $f''(x) < 0$, the function is **concave down** (like a sad face ðŸ˜ž), and the point is a **local maximum**.\n",

    "The Hessian matrix provides the exact same information for functions of multiple variables, but instead of checking the sign of a single number, we check the signs of the Hessian's **eigenvalues**.\n",

    "## Case 1: Concave Up (Local Minimum)\n",
    "\n",
    "A function of two variables is **concave up** if its graph looks like a bowl or a paraboloid opening upwards. If we find a point where the gradient is zero and the function is concave up, that point must be a **local minimum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Test:** A function is concave up if **all** the eigenvalues of its Hessian matrix are **positive**. A matrix with this property is called **positive-definite**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** $f(x, y) = 2x^2 + 3y^2 - xy$\n",
    "* **Hessian:** $H = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 6 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "* **Eigenvalues:** Solving the characteristic equation, we find $\\lambda_1 \\approx 6.41$ and $\\lambda_2 \\approx 3.59$.\n",
    "* **Conclusion:** Since both eigenvalues are positive, the function is concave up, and the point `(0, 0)` (where the gradient is zero) is a local minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Case 2: Concave Down (Local Maximum)\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is **concave down** if its graph looks like a dome opening downwards. If the gradient is zero at a point and the function is concave down, that point is a **local maximum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Test:** A function is concave down if **all** the eigenvalues of its Hessian matrix are **negative**. This is called a **negative-definite** matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** $f(x, y) = -2x^2 - 3y^2 - xy + 15$\n",
    "* **Hessian:** $H = \\begin{bmatrix} -4 & -1 \\\\ -1 & -6 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "* **Eigenvalues:** $\\lambda_1 \\approx -6.41$ and $\\lambda_2 \\approx -3.59$.\n",
    "* **Conclusion:** Since both eigenvalues are negative, the function is concave down, and the point `(0, 0)` is a local maximum.\n",

    "---\n",
    "## Case 3: Saddle Point\n",
    "\n",
    "What if the eigenvalues have mixed signs? This occurs at a **saddle point**, which is neither a minimum nor a maximum. From one direction it looks like a minimum, and from another, it looks like a maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Test:** If the Hessian has both **positive and negative eigenvalues**, the critical point is a **saddle point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** $f(x, y) = 2x^2 - 2y^2$\n",
    "* **Hessian:** $H = \\begin{bmatrix} 4 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -4 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "* **Eigenvalues:** $\\lambda_1 = 4$ and $\\lambda_2 = -4$.\n",
