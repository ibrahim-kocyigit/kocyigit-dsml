    "1.  **Slice 1 (Fix y=4):** Imagine we slice our 3D surface with the plane `y = 4`. The intersection of these two surfaces is a simple 2D parabola.\n",

    "    * Our function becomes: $f(2, y) = 2^2 + y^2 = 4 + y^2$.\n",
    "    * We can take the derivative of this with respect to `y`: $f'(y) = 2y$.\n",
    "    * At our point where `y=4`, the slope of the tangent line in this direction is $2(4) = 8$.\n",

    "Since we have two distinct tangent lines that cross at our point of interest, they uniquely define the **tangent plane** to the surface at that point.\n",
