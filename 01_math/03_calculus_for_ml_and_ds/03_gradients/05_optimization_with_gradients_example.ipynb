    "## Finding the Minimum\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned with one-variable functions, the minimum of a function occurs where its derivative is zero. For a function of two variables, this means the **tangent plane** is horizontal, which happens when **both partial derivatives are simultaneously zero**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we need to find the point `(x, y)` where the gradient is the zero vector:\n",
    "$$ \\nabla T(x, y) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Temperature Function:**\n",
    "$$ T(x, y) = 85 - \\frac{1}{90}(x^3 - 6x^2)(y^3 - 6y^2) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Find the Partial Derivatives\n",
    "After applying the product rule and simplifying, we get the partial derivatives:\n",
    "* $ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{1}{90} (3x^2 - 12x)(y^3 - 6y^2) = -\\frac{1}{90} (3x(x-4))(y^2(y-6)) $  \n",
    "\n",
    "* $ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{90} (x^3 - 6x^2)(3y^2 - 12y) = -\\frac{1}{90} (x^2(x-6))(3y(y-4)) $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Set Both Derivatives to Zero\n",
    "We need to find the `(x, y)` pairs that solve this system of equations:\n",
    "1.  $-\\frac{1}{90} (3x(x-4))(y^2(y-6)) = 0$  \n",
    "\n",

    "* `y = 0`\n",

    "### Step 3: Find the Common Solutions\n",
    "We need the points `(x, y)` that satisfy **both** equations. By checking the possible combinations, we find the \"critical points\" where the gradient is zero: `(0,0)`, `(0,4)`, `(0,6)`, `(4,0)`, `(4,4)`, `(6,0)`, `(6,4)`, and `(6,6)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Evaluate the Candidates\n",
    "Finally, we evaluate the temperature function at each of these candidate points (within our 5x5 sauna) to find which one is the true minimum.\n",
