    "A matrix is in RREF if it satisfies two conditions:\n",
    "1.  It is in row echelon form.\n",
    "2.  Every entry in a column that contains a pivot must be zero (except for the pivot itself). This means we eliminate the non-zero values both **below and above** the pivots.\n",

    "The process to get from REF to RREF is to **use the pivot in each row to eliminate any non-zero entries *above* it.** This is essentially the back-substitution step from solving equations, but performed with row operations.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Operation:** New Row 1 = Row 1 - (2 * Row 2)  \n",

    "This gives us the final RREF matrix:  \n",

    "Let's take a larger matrix that is already in row echelon form and convert it to RREF. The process is the same: start from the bottom pivot and work your way up, clearing the entries above each pivot.\n",
