A transformation with a negative determinant \"flips\" the space, so that the transformed $\\hat{j}$ is now on the \"wrong\" side of the transformed $\\hat{i}$.\n",

    "The **absolute value** of the determinant, $|-5| = 5$, still tells us the scaling factor of the area. For determining singularity, all that matters is whether the determinant is **zero** or **non-zero**.\n",
