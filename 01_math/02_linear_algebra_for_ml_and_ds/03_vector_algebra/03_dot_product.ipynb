    "The **dot product** is a fundamental operation in linear algebra that allows us to combine two vectors to get a single number (a scalar). It has many uses, including a very nice and compact way to express systems of linear equations.\n",

    "## An Intuitive Example: Calculating Total Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple problem. Imagine you are buying fruit:\n",
    "* 2 apples\n",
    "* 4 bananas\n",
    "* 1 cherry\n",
    "\n",
    "The prices for each fruit are:\n",
    "* Apple: 3 dollars\n",
    "* Banana: 5 dollars\n",
    "* Cherry: 2 dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How much does everything cost in total?\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this, we can represent our quantities and prices as vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quantity Vector (q):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ q = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "  \n",
    "* **Price Vector (p):**  \n",
    "\n",
    "    $ p = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The total cost is found by multiplying the quantity of each fruit by its price and summing the results:\n",
    "* Cost of apples: $2 \\times 3 = 6$ dollars\n",
    "* Cost of bananas: $4 \\times 5 = 20$ dollars\n",
    "* Cost of cherries: $1 \\times 2 = 2$ dollars\n",
    "* **Total Cost:** $6 + 20 + 2 = 28$ dollars\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation—multiplying corresponding components and then summing them up—is exactly the **dot product**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formalizing the Dot Product\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write the operation above more compactly. It's common to write the first vector as a row vector and the second as a column vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product of our two vectors is:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\cdot \\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 2 \\end{bmatrix} = (2)(3) + (4)(5) + (1)(2) = 28\n",

    "## Connection Between Dot Product and L2-Norm\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a very useful connection between the dot product and the L2-norm (or magnitude) of a vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the vector $v = (4, 3)$, whose L2-norm was 5. Notice what happens when we take the dot product of the vector *with itself*:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$ v \\cdot v = (4)(4) + (3)(3) = 16 + 9 = 25 $  \n",
    "\n",
    "This result, 25, is the square of the L2-norm ($5^2$).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is always true. The L2-norm of a vector is the **square root of the dot product of the vector with itself**: $ ||v||_2 = \\sqrt{v \\cdot v} $\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Transpose Operation\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation of converting a column vector into a row vector (or vice-versa) is called the **transpose**. It is denoted by a superscript `T`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $ v = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} $, then its transpose is $ v^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also transpose a matrix. This is done by turning each of its columns into a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 7 \\\\ 4 & 8 \\\\ 1 & 9 \\end{bmatrix} $ (a 3x2 matrix), then its transpose is $ A^T = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 & 4 & 1 \\\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{bmatrix} $ (a 2x3 matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the dimensions of the matrix swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## General Definition of the Dot Product\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two vectors, $x$ and $y$, with the same number of components ($n$):  \n",
    "\n",
    "$ x = (x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) $  \n",
    "$ y = (y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product is the sum of the products of their corresponding components:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$ x \\cdot y = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + \\dots + x_ny_n $  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other common notations for the dot product include angled brackets, `<x, y>`, or using the transpose to ensure a row vector is multiplied by a column vector, $x^T y$."
