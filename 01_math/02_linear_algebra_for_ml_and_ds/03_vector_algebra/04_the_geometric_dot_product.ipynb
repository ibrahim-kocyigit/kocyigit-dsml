    "We know two special cases:\n",
    "1.  $v \\cdot v = ||v||^2$ (The dot product of a vector with itself is its magnitude squared).\n",
    "2.  If $u \\perp v$, then $u \\cdot v = 0$.\n",

    "What about the dot product for any two vectors `u` and `v`? The formula connects the dot product to the angle, $\\theta$, between the two vectors.\n",

    "> **Geometric Formula for the Dot Product:**  \n",
    "> $ u \\cdot v = ||u|| \\cdot ||v|| \\cdot \\cos(\\theta) $\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula tells us that the dot product is the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors, scaled by the cosine of the angle between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term $||u|| \\cos(\\theta)$ represents the **projection** of vector `u` onto vector `v`â€”the \"shadow\" that `u` casts on `v`. So, the dot product is the length of this shadow multiplied by the length of `v`.\n",

    "## The Sign of the Dot Product\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula gives us a powerful intuition: the **sign** of the dot product tells us about the angle between the vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a vector $v = (6, 2)$. Any vector orthogonal to it will have a dot product of 0.\n",
    "* Vectors that form an **acute angle** ($< 90^\\circ$) with `v` will have a **positive** dot product.\n",
    "* Vectors that form an **obtuse angle** ($> 90^\\circ$) with `v` will have a **negative** dot product.\n",
    "\n",
    "This effectively divides the entire 2D plane into three regions relative to vector `v`.\n",
