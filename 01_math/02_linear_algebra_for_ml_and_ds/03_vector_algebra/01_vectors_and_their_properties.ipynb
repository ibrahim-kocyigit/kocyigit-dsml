    "\n",
    "The magnitude, or **norm**, of a vector is its size or length. There are several ways to measure this, but they all relate to our real-world understanding of distance. The two most common are the L1-norm and the L2-norm.\n",

    "### L1-Norm: The \"Taxicab\" Distance\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are in a city grid and can only travel along horizontal and vertical streets. To get from the origin (0,0) to the point (4,3), you must travel 4 blocks horizontally and 3 blocks vertically, for a total distance of 7 blocks.\n",

    "This is the **L1-norm**. For a vector `v = (a, b)`, the formula is:  \n",

    "We use absolute values because distance is always positive.\n",

    "### L2-Norm: The \"Helicopter\" Distance\n",

    "Now imagine you can travel in a straight line from the origin to the point (4,3), like a helicopter. This direct distance is the length of the vector's arrow.\n",

    "Using the Pythagorean theorem, this distance is $\\sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \\sqrt{16 + 9} = \\sqrt{25} = 5$.\n",
