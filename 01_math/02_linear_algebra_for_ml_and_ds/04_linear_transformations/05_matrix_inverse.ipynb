    "There are two main ways to find the inverse of a matrix by hand. The first is conceptual, and the second is a practical algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method 1: The Conceptual Approach (Solving a System)\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the entries of the inverse, we can set up and solve a system of linear equations. Let our original matrix be $A = \\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}$ and its unknown inverse be $A^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",

    "\\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$  \n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a system of four equations, which can be solved for a, b, c, and d. While this works for a 2x2 matrix, it quickly becomes unmanageable for larger matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Method 2: The Practical Algorithm (Gauss-Jordan Elimination)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the standard, scalable method for finding an inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Create an **augmented matrix** by placing your original matrix `A` on the left and the **identity matrix `I`** of the same size on the right. Our goal is to transform `[A | I]`.\n",
    "2.  Use **row operations** to transform the left side (`A`) into the identity matrix.\n",
    "3.  Apply the exact same row operations to the right side (`I`) simultaneously.\n",
    "4.  When the left side becomes the identity matrix, the right side will have become the **inverse matrix, `A⁻¹`**. The final form will be `[I | A⁻¹]`.\n",

If you try to perform Gauss-Jordan elimination on a singular matrix, you will find it impossible to get the identity matrix on the left side because you will end up with a row of all zeros."
