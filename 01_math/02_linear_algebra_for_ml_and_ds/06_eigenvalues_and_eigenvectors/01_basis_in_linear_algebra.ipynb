    "A fundamental concept in linear algebra is the **basis** of a vector space. We've seen this idea before when we discussed how a matrix transforms the \"fundamental square\" into a parallelogram. In reality, what matters most are not the shapes themselves, but the two vectors that define them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **basis** is a set of vectors that has two key properties:\n",
    "1.  The vectors are **linearly independent** (in 2D, this means they are not parallel).\n",
    "2.  They **span** the entire space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main property of a basis is that any point in the space can be reached by a unique **linear combination** of the basis vectors. This means we can get to any target point by simply \"walking\" along the directions of our basis vectors.\n",

    "Almost any two vectors in a 2D plane will form a basis. The only exception is when the two vectors are **linearly dependent**â€”meaning they lie on the same line (they are collinear).\n",
    "\n",
    "If two vectors point in the same (or exact opposite) directions, you can only move back and forth along a single line. It's impossible to \"walk\" off this line to reach every other point in the plane. Therefore, these two vectors **do not form a basis** for the 2D plane. They only span a 1D subspace (a line).\n",
