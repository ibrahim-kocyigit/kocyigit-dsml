    "Does an *n* x *n* matrix always have *n* distinct eigenvectors? The answer is **no**. Sometimes, a matrix can have fewer eigenvectors than its dimension. This happens when we have **repeated eigenvalues**. Let's explore two examples to see how this works.\n",

    "    We solve the system $(A - 2I)v = 0$. This leads to the single equation $-x_1 + 2x_2 - 0.5x_3 = 0$. This equation has two \"free variables,\" meaning we can choose two variables and the third will be determined. This allows us to find **two linearly independent eigenvectors** that satisfy this equation. For example:\n",
    "    * If we choose $x_2=1, x_3=0$, then $x_1=2$. This gives us $ v_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} $.  \n",

    "    We solve the system $(B - 2I)v = 0$. This leads to a different set of equations, which simplify to two constraints: $x_1=0$ and $x_3=4x_2$. Now, we only have **one free variable**. Once we choose a value for $x_2$, the other variables are fixed.\n",
    "    * If we choose $x_2=1$, then $x_1=0$ and $x_3=4$. This gives the eigenvector $ v_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 4 \\end{bmatrix} $.\n",
    "    * Any other choice for $x_2$ will just give us a scaled version of this same vector (e.g., if $x_2=0.5$, we get `(0, 0.5, 2)`). We cannot find a second, linearly independent eigenvector for this eigenvalue.\n",
