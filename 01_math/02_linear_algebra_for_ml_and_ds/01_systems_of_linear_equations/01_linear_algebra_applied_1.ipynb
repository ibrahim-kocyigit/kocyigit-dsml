    "\n",
    "One of the most common machine learning models, **linear regression**, provides a perfect entry point into systems of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is a **supervised machine learning** technique. This means we start with a dataset containing known inputs (features) and a corresponding output (target). The goal is to discover the underlying relationship between them.\n",

    "### Single-Feature Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine we want to predict the electrical power output of a wind turbine based on a single feature: wind speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **x-axis**: Wind Speed (our input feature)\n",
    "* **y-axis**: Power Output (our target)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we plot our collected data points, we might see a clear pattern. The objective of linear regression is to find the **line of best fit** that models this data:\n",

    "The equation for the line above is the familiar:\n",

    "### Multi-Feature Linear Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In most real-world scenarios, you'll use more than one feature to make a prediction. Let's add **temperature** to our wind turbine model. The equation now needs a new weight for the new feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = w_1(\\text{wind\\_speed}) + w_2(\\text{temperature}) + b $$\n",

    "With two features, our model is no longer a line in a 2D plane. It's now a **plane** in a 3D space. We can extend this idea to any number of features ($n$), such as pressure, humidity, etc. The generalized equation for $n$ features becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\dots + w_nx_n + b $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ represent the different input features. Conceptually, it works the same way: we need to find the right values for all the weights ($w_1, \\dots, w_n$) and the bias ($b$) to make accurate predictions.\n",

    "## From Regression to Systems of Equations\n",

    "In a typical machine learning dataset, you don't have just one data point; you have many records (let's say $m$ records). Each record gives us a complete equation where the feature values ($x$'s) and the target value ($y$) are known. The unknowns we need to solve for are the weights and the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write one equation for each record in our dataset. We use a superscript in parentheses to denote the record number. **Note: this is an index, not an exponent.**\n",

    "Ideally, we want to find a single set of weights ($w_1, \\dots, w_n$) and a single bias ($b$) that solve all $m$ equations at the same time (or come as close as possible).\n",

    "This collection of multiple linear equations that we want to solve simultaneously is a fundamental concept known as a **system of linear equations**. This will be our main topic of study."
