## Linear Algebra
Linear Algebra is the language of data. It provides the mathematical foundation for representing datasets as vectors and matrices and for understanding the operations and transformations applied to them.

Virtually all machine learning and deep learning models rely on linear algebra, from the simple dot products in a regression model to the complex tensor manipulations in a neural network. Advanced concepts like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are a direct application of an eigendecomposition, a core topic in this section.
