## Precalculus
Precalculus provides the essential foundation upon which the study of calculus is built. This section covers the key algebraic and geometric topics required to master the concepts of limits, derivatives, and integrals.

Many of these concepts—especially vectors, matrices, and series—are not just prerequisites for calculus but are fundamental data structures and tools used directly in machine learning and data science for representing data and approximating complex functions.

The notes in this section are curated from my studies of the [Precalculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) course on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).
