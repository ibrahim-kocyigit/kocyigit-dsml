## Calculus
Calculus is a cornerstone of machine learning, providing the essential tools to understand and optimize complex models. It is the language of change, allowing us to find the "best" parameters for a model by navigating error landscapes through differentiation and to quantify cumulative effects through integration.

Key ML concepts rooted in calculus include Gradient Descent, the core optimization algorithm that powers deep learning, and the backpropagation algorithm.

The notes in this section are curated from my studies of the comprehensive Calculus curriculum ([Precalculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus), [AP Calculus BC](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc), [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus), [Differential Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations)) on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/).
