    "Before we dive deep into the algebra of linear equations, let's start with a more intuitive idea: thinking of equations as sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single sentence (or equation) provides a piece of information. A **system of sentences** (or equations) combines multiple pieces of information. The way these sentences interact to build a complete picture is very similar to how equations work together. The goal is always to get as much clear information as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Systems: What's the Animal's Color?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple scenario. Assume you have one dog and one cat, and each animal has only one color. Your goal is to figure out their colors based on the information provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### System 1: A Complete System\n",
    "* **Sentence 1:** \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "* **Sentence 2:** \"The cat is orange.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:** We have 2 sentences and they give us 2 distinct pieces of information. This is a **complete** system. We know everything we need to.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### System 2: A Redundant System\n",
    "* **Sentence 1:** \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "* **Sentence 2:** \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:** We have 2 sentences, but the second one adds no new information. It just repeats the first. This system only provides 1 unique piece of information. It is **redundant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### System 3: A Contradictory System\n",
    "* **Sentence 1:** \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "* **Sentence 2:** \"The dog is white.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:** The two sentences conflict with each other. Since we know the dog can only have one color, this information is impossible to resolve. The system is **contradictory**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## New Terminology: Singular vs. Non-Singular\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of information a system carries is critical. This leads us to two very important terms that you will use throughout your study of linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Non-singular System** ✅\n",
    "    A system that is **complete**. It carries as many unique pieces of information as it has sentences (or equations). It's the most informative and useful type of system.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Singular System** ⚠️\n",
    "    A system that is either **redundant** or **contradictory**. It is less informative than a non-singular system because information is either repeated or nonsensical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these definitions:\n",
    "* System 1 (\"The dog is black.\", \"The cat is orange.\") is **non-singular**.\n",
    "* System 2 (\"The dog is black.\", \"The dog is black.\") is **singular**.\n",
    "* System 3 (\"The dog is black.\", \"The dog is white.\") is **singular**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Systems with More Sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept scales up to any number of sentences. Let's consider a new scenario with three animals: a dog, a cat, and a bird.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **System 1:**\n",
    "    1.  \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "    2.  \"The cat is orange.\"\n",
    "    3.  \"The bird is red.\"\n",
    "    *  **Result:** 3 sentences, 3 pieces of info. This is **complete** and **non-singular**.  \n",

    "    1.  \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "    2.  \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "    3.  \"The bird is red.\"\n",
    "    * **Result:** 3 sentences, but only 2 pieces of info. This is **redundant** and **singular**.  \n",
    "`---`\n",
    "* **System 3:**\n",
    "    1.  \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "    2.  \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "    3.  \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "    * **Result:** 3 sentences, but only 1 piece of info. This is highly **redundant** and **singular**.  \n",
    "`---`\n",
    "* **System 4:**\n",
    "    1.  \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "    2.  \"The dog is white.\"\n",
    "    3.  \"The bird is red.\"\n",
    "    * **Result:** The first two sentences conflict. This is **contradictory** and **singular**.  \n",
    " \n",
    "> **Future Concept:** Notice that System 3 is \"more redundant\" than System 2. There is a mathematical measure for this called **rank**, which you will learn about later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Logic Puzzle 🧩\n",
    "\n",
    "Systems aren't always straightforward. Sometimes you need to deduce the information. Consider this system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sentence 1:** \"Between the dog, the cat, and the bird, one of them is red.\"\n",
    "* **Sentence 2:** \"Between the dog and the cat, one of them is orange.\"\n",
    "* **Sentence 3:** \"The dog is black.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these sentences, can you answer these two questions?\n",
    "1.  What color is the bird?\n",
    "2.  Is this system singular or non-singular?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution to the Logic Puzzle\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's solve this step-by-step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Start with the most direct fact.** Sentence 3 tells us plainly: **The dog is black**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Use that information in the next sentence.** Sentence 2 says one of the dog or cat is orange. Since we now know the dog is black, it logically follows that **the cat must be orange**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Use both facts in the final sentence.** Sentence 1 says one of the three animals is red. We've established the dog is black and the cat is orange. Therefore, **the bird must be red**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Answering the Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **What color is the bird?** The bird is **red**.\n",
    "2.  **Is the system singular or non-singular?** We started with 3 sentences and were able to determine 3 unique pieces of information (the color of each of the three animals). The system contains no redundancies or contradictions. Therefore, it is a **complete** system and is **non-singular**."
