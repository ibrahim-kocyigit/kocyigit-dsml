    "Before we dive into the full process of row reduction, it's important to understand the fundamental manipulations we can perform on a matrix. These are called **row operations**, and they are the exact same operations we used to solve systems of linear equations, just applied to the rows of a matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical property of these operations is that they **preserve the singularity** of a matrix. This means:\n",
    "* If you apply a row operation to a **singular** matrix, the result is still a **singular** matrix.\n",
    "* If you apply a row operation to a **non-singular** matrix, the result is still a **non-singular** matrix.\n",

    "$ \\det(A) = (5)(3) - (1)(4) = 15 - 4 = 11 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the determinant is **11** (non-zero), the matrix is **non-singular**.\n",

    "The new determinant is **-11**. Since it's still non-zero, the matrix is still **non-singular**. Notice that switching two rows negates the determinant. If the original determinant had been 0, the new one would also be 0.\n",
