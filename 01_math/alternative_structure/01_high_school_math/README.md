# High School Math (Precalculus)

This section provides the essential mathematical foundation required before diving into the more specialized topics of Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics for Machine Learning.

The curriculum covers a broad range of advanced high school math topics, primarily from Precalculus, that build the fluency needed for higher-level concepts. Key areas like vectors, matrices, logarithms, and series are not just prerequisites for advanced math, but are tools used directly in data science and machine learning.

The notes in this section are curated from my studies of the comprehensive [Precalculus curriculum on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus), supplemented with their excellent section on [Logarithms](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra2/x2ec2f6f830c9fb89:logs).
