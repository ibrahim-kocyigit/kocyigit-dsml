    "\n",
    "Imagine a game where you roll a fair six-sided die. The payoff you receive is the **square** of the number you roll.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** What is a fair price to pay to play this game?\n",

    "$$ E[X^2] = (1 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) + (4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) + (9 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) + (16 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) + (25 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) + (36 \\cdot \\frac{1}{6}) $$\n",

    "\n",
    "We can calculate the expected value of the payoffs directly:\n",
    "$$ E[2X - 5] = \\frac{-3 + (-1) + 1 + 3 + 5 + 7}{6} = \\frac{12}{6} = 2 $$\n",
    "On average, you can expect to win 2 dollars per game.\n",

    "$$ E[2X - 5] = \\frac{(2 \\cdot 1 - 5) + (2 \\cdot 2 - 5) + \\dots + (2 \\cdot 6 - 5)}{6} $$\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{2(1+2+3+4+5+6) - (6 \\cdot 5)}{6} $$\n",

    "$$ = 2 \\cdot E[X] - 5 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected value of the roll of a fair die, `E[X]`, is 3.5. So, $2 \\cdot (3.5) - 5 = 7 - 5 = 2$. This gives us the same result.\n",

    "This reveals a very important property called the **Linearity of Expectation**.\n",

    "> **Rule:** For any random variable `X` and any constants `a` and `b`:\n",
    "> $$ E[aX + b] = aE[X] + b $$\n",
