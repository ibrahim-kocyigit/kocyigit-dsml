    "* **Game 1:** You flip a fair coin. Heads, you win 1 dollar. Tails, you lose 1 dollar.\n",
    "    * The expected value is `E[X₁] = (1 * 0.5) + (-1 * 0.5) = 0`.\n",

    "Both games have the same expected value of 0. On average, you would break even playing either game. However, Game 2 is clearly much riskier. Its outcomes are far more spread out. We need a way to quantify this difference in spread, and that's the job of the variance."

    "\n",
    "To quantify spread, our first instinct might be to calculate the average **deviation** from the mean, `X - E[X]`. However, because the mean is the balancing point, the positive and negative deviations always cancel out, and the average deviation is always zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard approach is to use the **squared deviation**, `(X - E[X])²`. This makes all deviations positive and heavily penalizes outcomes that are far from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Definition:** The **variance**, denoted as `Var(X)` or `σ²`, is the expected value (or average) of the squared deviation.\n",
    "> $$ \\text{Var}(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2] $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the variance for our two games:\n",
    "* **Game 1:** The squared deviations are $(-1-0)^2=1$ and $(1-0)^2=1$.\n",
    "    * `Var(X₁) = (1 * 0.5) + (1 * 0.5) = 1`\n",
    "* **Game 2:** The squared deviations are $(-100-0)^2=10000$ and $(100-0)^2=10000$.\n",
    "    * `Var(X₂) = (10000 * 0.5) + (10000 * 0.5) = 10000`\n",

    "While the definition above is intuitive, an alternative formula is often easier for calculations:\n",
    "> **Alternative Formula:**\n",
    "> $$ \\text{Var}(X) = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 $$\n",

    "## Properties of Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance has a very important property related to scaling and shifting a random variable.\n",
    "> **Rule:** For any random variable `X` and any constants `a` and `b`:\n",
    "> $$ \\text{Var}(aX + b) = a^2\\text{Var}(X) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break this down:\n",
    "* **Adding a constant `b` does not change the variance.** Shifting a distribution left or right changes its mean, but it does **not** change its spread.\n",
    "* **Multiplying by a constant `a` scales the variance by `a²`.** If you double the value of all outcomes, you are also doubling their deviations from the mean. Since variance is based on the *squared* deviation, the total variance increases by a factor of $2^2 = 4$."
