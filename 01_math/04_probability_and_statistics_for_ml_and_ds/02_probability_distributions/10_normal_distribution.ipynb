    "Now we will learn about one of the most popular and important distributions in all of statistics and machine learning: the **Normal Distribution**, also known as the **Gaussian Distribution** or the \"bell curve.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It appears everywhere in science and real life. One of the reasons for this is that when we add up many independent random processes, their combined effect tends to follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Binomial to Normal\n",
    "A great way to build intuition for the normal distribution is to see it as a limit of the **binomial distribution**. Recall that the binomial distribution models the number of heads in *n* coin tosses.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the number of coin tosses (`n`) gets very large, the shape of the binomial distribution's histogram begins to look more and more like a smooth, continuous bell curve. This bell curve is the normal distribution.\n",

    "* **The Mean ($\\mu$):** This parameter controls the **center** of the bell curve.\n",
    "* **The Standard Deviation ($\\sigma$):** This parameter controls the **spread** or \"wideness\" of the bell curve. A small `σ` gives a tall, skinny curve, while a large `σ` gives a short, wide curve.\n",

    "The first part of the formula, $\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$, is a scaling constant that ensures the total area under the curve is exactly 1. The important part is the exponential term, which creates the characteristic bell shape centered at `μ` and scaled by `σ`.  \n",

    "The CDF of the normal distribution, which gives the area under the curve up to a certain point, does not have a simple formula. In the past, people used large tables of data to look up these values. Today, we use software to calculate them.\n",
