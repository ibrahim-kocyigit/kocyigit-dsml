    "* **Discrete:** The outcomes can be put in a list (e.g., number of heads: 0, 1, 2, 3...).\n",

    "### The Problem with Exact Points\n",
    "\n",
    "For a continuous variable, the probability of it taking on any single, *exact* value is zero. For example, what is the probability that a support call lasts *exactly* 1 minute, to the infinitesimal decimal? Since there are infinitely many possible call durations, the probability of any one specific duration is effectively zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we can't use a Probability Mass Function (PMF) like we did for discrete variables, where we assigned a probability to each specific outcome.\n",

    "## The Solution: Probabilities Over Intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of asking for the probability of an exact point, we ask for the probability that the outcome falls **within a certain interval or window**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our call center example, we can ask:\n",
    "* What is the probability that a call lasts between 0 and 1 minute?\n",
    "* What is the probability that a call lasts between 1 and 2 minutes?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent these probabilities with a histogram, where the area of the bars sums to 1. As we make our time intervals (the bins of the histogram) smaller and smaller, the histogram begins to look like a smooth curve.\n",

    "\n",
    "The smooth curve that emerges when our intervals become infinitely small is called a **Probability Density Function (PDF)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a PMF where the height of a bar is the probability, the height of the PDF curve is **not** a probability. It represents the \"density\" of probability at that point.\n",

    "\n",
    "> **Key Rule:** For a continuous probability distribution, the **total area under the PDF curve must equal 1**. The probability of an outcome falling within a certain range is the area under the curve in that range."
