    "In discrete distributions, we can assign a specific probability to each possible outcome. For example, there is a specific probability of getting exactly 3 heads in 10 coin flips.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for a **continuous distribution**, the probability of the random variable taking on any single, exact value is **zero**. For example, the probability that a support call lasts *exactly* 2 minutes (2.000... seconds) is zero because there are infinitely many possible call durations.\n",

    "Let's revisit our call center example. We can start by creating a histogram where the bars represent the probability that a call's duration falls within a certain window (e.g., between 2 and 3 minutes). The total area of all the bars adds up to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we make these windows (or \"bins\") smaller and smaller, the histogram begins to resemble a smooth curve. This smooth curve is called the **Probability Density Function (PDF)**.  \n",

    "The function that describes this curve is called the **Probability Density Function (PDF)**, often written as a lowercase `f(x)`. It is the continuous equivalent of the Probability Mass Function (PMF).\n",

    "A crucial point to remember is that for a continuous variable, probability is **not** the height of the curve. The height represents the \"density\" or concentration of probability at that point.\n",

    "### Properties of a Valid PDF\n",
    "\n",
    "A function `f(x)` must satisfy three conditions to be considered a valid PDF:\n",
    "1.  **It must be defined for all real numbers.** (It can be zero for many values, for example, the probability of a negative call duration is zero).\n",
    "2.  **It must be non-negative everywhere.** $f(x) \\ge 0$. This makes sense, as we cannot have negative probabilities.\n",
    "3.  **The total area under the entire curve must be equal to 1.** This represents the certainty that the outcome will be *some* value.\n",
