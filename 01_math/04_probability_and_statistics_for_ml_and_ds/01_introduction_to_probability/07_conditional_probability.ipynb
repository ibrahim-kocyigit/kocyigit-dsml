    "In this lesson, we will explore the concept of **conditional probability**. This is all about calculating the probability of an event happening, **given that another event has already occurred**.\n",
    "\n",
    "New information can change the probability of an outcome. For example, the probability of it being humid today is some number. However, if we are *given* the information that it rained yesterday, the probability of it being humid today might change.\n",

    "Recall our experiment of flipping two fair coins. The sample space has four equally likely outcomes: **{HH, HT, TH, TT}**.\n",

    "The probability of getting two heads is:\n",

    "Now, let's introduce a condition.\n",

    "**New Question:** What is the probability that both coins land on heads, **given that we know the first coin landed on heads?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This new piece of information—\"the first coin landed on heads\"—**reduces our sample space**. We are no longer considering all four possibilities. The outcomes where the first coin was tails (TH, TT) are now impossible.\n",

    "Within this new sample space of 2 outcomes, there is only 1 favorable outcome (HH). Therefore, the new probability is:\n",

    "* Now, *given that* the first die is a 6, what is the probability that the sum is 10? Our sample space is now just the 6 outcomes where the first die is a 6: {(6,1), (6,2), (6,3), (6,4), (6,5), (6,6)}. Within this space, only one outcome, (6,4), gives a sum of 10. So, $P(\\text{Sum=10} \\text{ | First=6}) = \\frac{1}{6}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that if we multiply these, we get the right answer:\n",
