    "How do we find the overall probability of being diagnosed sick? A person can be diagnosed sick in two mutually exclusive ways:\n",
    "1.  They are sick AND are correctly diagnosed sick.\n",
    "2.  They are healthy AND are incorrectly diagnosed sick.\n",

    "$$ P(B) = (P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)) + (P(A') \\cdot P(B|A')) $$\n",
