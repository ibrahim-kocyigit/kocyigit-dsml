# Stage 5: Data Understanding

*"After the original data collection, data scientists typically use descriptive statistics and visualization techniques to understand the data content, assess data quality and discover initial insights about the data. Additional data collection may be necessary to fill gaps."* - **John B. Rollins**


## Purpose

The goal of this stage is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to develop a deep understanding of the data's content, quality, and structure. Through descriptive statistics and visualization, we aim to uncover initial patterns, spot anomalies or data quality issues, and validate (or challenge) the initial hypotheses formed during the business understanding phase.


## Step 1: Descriptive Statistics

Compute summary statistics to get a high-level quantitative overview of the dataset.

  * **Action:** Generate and analyze descriptive statistics for all numerical and categorical features.
  * **Toolkit Connection:** This step primarily uses the `pandas.DataFrame.describe()` method.

> **Numerical Feature Summary (`df.describe()`):**
>
> ```
> > [Paste the output of df.describe() for numerical columns here. Analyze the count, mean, std, min, max, and quartile values for initial insights into scale and spread.]
> ```
>
> **Categorical Feature Summary (`df.describe(include='object')`):**
>
> ```
> > [Paste the output of df.describe(include='object') here. Analyze the count, unique values, top (most frequent) category, and frequency.]
> ```


## Step 2: Univariate Analysis

Analyze individual variables to understand their own distributions and characteristics.

  * **Action:** Create visualizations for key individual variables.
  * **Guiding Questions:**
      * How is the target variable distributed?
      * What is the distribution of key numerical features (e.g., normal, skewed, bimodal)?
      * What are the frequency counts of key categorical features?
  * **Toolkit Connection:** This step uses `seaborn.histplot`, `seaborn.kdeplot`, and `seaborn.countplot`.

> **Univariate Analysis Plots:**
>
> *[Embed or link to key visualizations, e.g., `univariate_plots.png`]*
>
> **Key Observations:**
>
> > *[Note any findings. Example: "The `Price` feature is heavily right-skewed, suggesting the presence of a few high-value outliers. A log transformation may be necessary in the data preparation stage."]*
> > *[Example: "The target variable `churn_status` is imbalanced, with class '1' representing only 15% of the dataset. This will require special handling (e.g., stratified splitting, appropriate metrics)."]*


## Step 3: Bivariate Analysis

Analyze pairs of variables to investigate relationships and correlations.

  * **Action:** Create visualizations to explore the relationships between features, and between features and the target variable.
  * **Guiding Questions:**
      * How do numerical features correlate with each other? Is there multicollinearity?
      * How does the target variable's distribution change across different categories of a feature?
      * Is there a linear or non-linear relationship between key numerical features?
  * **Toolkit Connection:** This step uses `seaborn.scatterplot`, `seaborn.boxplot`, and `seaborn.heatmap` on a correlation matrix (`df.corr()`).

> **Bivariate Analysis Plots:**
>
> *[Embed or link to key visualizations, e.g., a correlation heatmap and several boxplots.]*
>
> **Key Observations:**
>
> > *[Note any findings. Example: "There is a strong positive correlation (0.85) between `feature_A` and `feature_B`, suggesting potential multicollinearity."]*
> > *[Example: "The median `Price` for the 'Electronics' category is significantly higher than for 'Accessories', as shown in the box plot."]*


## Step 4: Initial Findings Summary

Consolidate all observations from the EDA into a summary.

  * **Action:** Create a bulleted list of the most important insights and data quality issues discovered.

> **EDA Summary:**
>
>   * **Key Insights:**
>       * *[List 2-3 of the most interesting business-relevant patterns found.]*
>   * **Data Quality Issues:**
>       * *[List any issues found, e.g., "The `last_login_date` column has 30% missing values." or "Detected significant outliers in the `order_value` column."]*
>   * **Revised Assumptions:**
>       * *[Note any initial assumptions that were challenged or validated by the data.]*


## Step 5: Final Review

Conclude the data understanding phase. Based on the findings (especially data quality issues), it may be necessary to revisit Stage 3 (Data Requirements) or Stage 4 (Data Collection).

  * **Action:** Prepare a brief summary report of the EDA findings for both technical and business stakeholders.
  * **Action:** Add a summary of this stage to the main project `README.md`.

> **Stage Summary:**
>
>   * ***Status:*** *[Completed]*
>   * ***Key Finding for Stakeholders:*** *[Translate one key insight into a simple business statement. Example: "Initial analysis shows that customers with a tenure of less than 6 months are significantly more likely to churn."]*
>   * ***Next Steps:*** *[Outline next steps. Example: "Proceed to Data Preparation stage. The discovered data quality issues (missing values, outliers) will be addressed as the first priority."]*
