# Methodology

A successful machine learning project is more than just code; it's a disciplined process. This pillar outlines the structured methodology used for every project within this repository, ensuring a clear path from a business idea to a deployed, value-generating solution.

The framework adopted here is the **[Foundational Methodology for Data Science](./references/IBMOpenSource_FoundationalMethologyforDataScience.PDF)** by **John B. Rollins**. It is a comprehensive 10-stage lifecycle that covers a project from inception to feedback, emphasizing clear communication, iterative development, and alignment with business goals.

Each stage is documented in its own file within this folder. These files serve as both an explanation of the process and as practical, reusable templates to be filled out for any new project.


## The 10 Stages of the Data Science Lifecycle

This lifecycle represents a repeatable process for delivering robust and effective analytic solutions.

1.  **[Business Understanding](./01_business_understanding.md)**: Defining the problem, objectives, and requirements from a purely business perspective.

2.  **[Analytic Approach](./02_analytic_approach.md)**: Translating the business problem into a formal data science framework, including selecting the ML problem type and technical success metrics.

3.  **[Data Requirements](./03_data_requirements.md)**: Specifying the exact data needed—including fields, formats, and sources—to execute the analytic approach.

4.  **[Data Collection](./04_data_collection.md)**: Gathering the required data from all identified sources into a central location.

5.  **[Data Understanding](./05_data_understanding.md)**: Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to assess data quality, discover initial patterns, and validate assumptions.

6.  **[Data Preparation](./06_data_preparation.md)**: Executing all data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering tasks to create the final dataset for modeling.

7.  **[Modeling](./07_modeling.md)**: Training, tuning, and selecting the best-performing model based on the cross-validation results from the training data.

8.  **[Evaluation](./08_evaluation.md)**: Performing a final, unbiased evaluation of the champion model on the held-back test set to measure its real-world performance.

9.  **[Deployment](./09_deployment.md)**: Integrating the validated model into the production environment to deliver business value.

10. **[Feedback](./10_feedback.md)**: Monitoring the deployed model's performance and impact to guide future iterations and ensure its value is maintained over time.
