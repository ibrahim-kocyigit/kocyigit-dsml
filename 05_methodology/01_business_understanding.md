# Stage 1: Business Understanding
_"Every project starts with business understanding. The business sponsors who need the analytic solution play the most critical role in this stage by defining the problem, project objectives and solution requirements from a business perspective. This first stage lays the foundation for a successful resolution of the business problem. To help guarantee the project's success, the sponsors should be involved throughout the project to provide the domain expertise, review intermediate findings and ensure the work remains on track to generate the intended solution."_ - **John B. Rollins**


## Purpose
The goal of this stage is to fully comprehend the project from a business perspective. All outputs should be framed in business terms to ensure alignment with stakeholders. The translation to an analytical problem will occur in Stage 2.

## Step 1: Initial Meeting & Information Gathering
The first step is to meet with all relevant stakeholders (business sponsors, domain experts, end-users) to gather information.

* **Action:** Schedule and attend initial meetings.
* **Guiding Questions:**
    * What specific problem are we trying to solve for the business?
    * What is the desired outcome? What does project success look like in business terms?
    * How will the business measure the impact of this solution (e.g., increased revenue, reduced costs, higher customer satisfaction)?
    * Who will be the end-user of this solution? How do they currently perform this task?
    * What are the known constraints (e.g., timeline, budget, regulations, data privacy)?
    * Who are the subject matter experts we can consult throughout the project?
* **Action:** Transcribe detailed notes from the meeting(s).

> * ***Attendees:*** *[List Attendees and Roles]*
> * ***Key Takeaways:*** *[Summarize the most important points, decisions, and action items here.]*


## Step 2: Define the Business Problem
Based on the gathered information, distill the core issue into a clear and concise statement.

* **Action:** Formulate the business problem statement.

> **Business Problem Statement:**
>
> * *[Insert a clear, one-to-two sentence summary of the business problem here. Example: "Customer churn in the premium subscription tier has increased by 15% over the last two quarters, leading to a significant revenue loss and impacting future growth projections."]*


## Step 3: Define Project Objectives
Translate the business problem into specific, measurable business goals.

* **Action:** List the primary and secondary objectives for the project in business terms.

> **Project Objectives & Success Criteria:**
>
> 1.  **Primary Objective:** *[Example: Reduce the rate of customer churn in the premium tier by at least 5% within the next six months.]*
> 2.  **Secondary Objective:** *[Example: Identify the top 5 factors that are most influential in a customer's decision to churn, to inform future marketing strategies.]*
> 3.  **Success Criteria:** *[Example: The solution's outputs should lead to a measurable increase in customer retention campaign effectiveness, benchmarked against the current process.]*


## Step 4: Define Solution Requirements
Outline the high-level requirements for the final solution from the perspective of its end-users and the business.

* **Action:** Detail the essential functionalities and constraints.

> **Solution Requirements:**
>
> * **Functionality:** *[Example: The solution must produce a weekly list of customers who are identified as high-risk.]*
> * **Usability:** *[Example: The business team must be able to understand the primary reasons provided for a customer's high-risk status.]*
> * **Integration:** *[Example: The final output list must be delivered in a CSV format to a designated shared drive.]*


## Step 5: Documentation and Validation
This final step ensures all stakeholders are aligned before any technical work begins.

* **Action:** Prepare the final draft of this "Business Understanding" document.
* **Action:** Distribute the document to all business sponsors for review, feedback, and validation.
* **Action:** Implement feedback and secure formal sign-off.
* **Action:** Add a summary of this stage to the main project README.md.
