# Analytic Approach Report

## Business Problem from a Technical Point
_Based on the business problem and objectives (from Stage 1), translate the problem into one or more potential machine learning or statistical tasks. For example, is this a classification, regression, clustering, anomaly detection, or time series forecasting problem? Consider multiple possible framings._

## Potential Models/Techniques
_List potential machine learning models or statistical techniques that are appropriate for the problem type(s) identified in Step 1. Consider the solution requirements (from Stage 1) â€“ are there constraints on model complexity, interpretability, or scalability?_

## Data Suitability Assessment
_Briefly consider (at a high level) whether the data likely to be available (we'll confirm this in later stages) will be suitable for the techniques identified. Are there likely to be enough features? Are the features likely to be predictive? This is a preliminary assessment, not a deep dive._

## Selected Primary Approach(es)
_Choose the primary analytic approach that you will pursue. This doesn't mean you can't explore other approaches later, but it's important to have a primary focus. Document the rationale for your choice._

## Conclusion
_Document the key findings, conclusions, and summaries from the report that will be incorporated into the main project `README.md`_
