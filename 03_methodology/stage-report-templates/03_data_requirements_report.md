# Data Requirements Report

## Required Data Content
_Based on the chosen analytic approach (from Stage 2), list the specific data elements (variables/features) required to build the model. What information is needed for each input and for the target variable (if applicable)? Be as precise as possible._

## Data Formats and Representations
_Specify the required data types (e.g., numerical, categorical, text, date/time) and formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, database tables) for each data element. Consider any specific representations needed (e.g., one-hot encoding for categorical variables, specific date/time formats)._

## Potential Data Source(s)
* _Identify the potential sources for each required data element. Where does this data reside? Is it in internal databases, external APIs, flat files, or other systems?_
* _For each data source, assess its availability and accessibility. Is the data readily available, or will it require special requests or approvals? Are there any known limitations or restrictions on accessing the data?_

## Conclusion
_Document the key findings, conclusions, and summaries from the report that will be incorporated into the main project `README.md`_
