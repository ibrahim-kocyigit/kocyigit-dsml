# Feedback Log

This document records feedback received on the deployed model, analysis of that feedback, and any actions taken in response.  It is a living document that should be updated continuously throughout the model's lifecycle.

## Feedback Entries

| Date       | Source of Feedback       | Description of Feedback                                                                                                                              | Root Cause Analysis (if applicable)                                                                                                                                 | Actions Taken                                                                                                                                                  | Results of Actions                                                                                                | Status        |

| 2024-01-15 | Performance Metrics      | Model accuracy decreased from 85% to 78% on data from 2024-01-08 to 2024-01-14.                                                                     | Potential data drift detected in `feature_3`. Distribution shifted significantly compared to the training data.                                                    | Updated data validation rules to flag unusual values in `feature_3`.  Scheduled retraining for next week with updated data.                                     | Accuracy improved to 82% after data validation changes. Awaiting retraining results.                                | In Progress   |
| 2024-01-20 | User Feedback (Sales Team) | Sales team reports that the model is flagging too many low-priority leads as high-priority, leading to wasted effort.                                | Model is overly sensitive to `feature_1`, which is correlated with lead size but not necessarily conversion probability.                                   | Adjusted the model's threshold for classifying high-priority leads.  Added `feature_5` (lead source) to the model to improve discrimination.                | False positive rate decreased by 10%. Sales team reports improved lead quality.                                           | Closed        |
| 2024-02-01 | System Logs            | Increased error rate in the prediction API.

Latency reduced.                                                             | Closed        |

**Template for New Entries:**

| Date       | Source of Feedback       | Description of Feedback                                      | Root Cause Analysis (if applicable)       |
| :--------- | :----------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------- |
| [Date]     | [Source]                 | [Detailed description of the feedback received]             | [Analysis of the underlying cause, if any] | [Actions taken to address feedback] | [Results of the actions taken] | [Open/Closed/In Progress]  |

**Status Definitions:**

*   **Open:**  Feedback has been received and logged, but investigation or action is still pending.
*   **In Progress:** Investigation or action is underway.
*   **Closed:**  Feedback has been addressed, and the issue is considered resolved.

**Notes:**

*   Be as specific as possible when describing the feedback. Include quantitative data whenever possible.
*   The "Root Cause Analysis" column is crucial for understanding *why* performance changed or issues arose.
*   The "Actions Taken" column should clearly describe the steps taken to address the feedback.
*   The "Results of Actions" column should track the impact of the changes made.
*   This log should be regularly reviewed and updated. It is a key part of the iterative model improvement process. This should ideally be integrated with a ticketing system.
