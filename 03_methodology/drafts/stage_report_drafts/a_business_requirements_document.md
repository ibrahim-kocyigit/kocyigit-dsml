# Business Requirements Document (BRD): [Project Name]

## 1. Introduction
* **Project Name:** [Same as Project Charter]
* **Date:** [Date of creation/last update]
* **Version:** [Version number, e.g., 1.0]
* **Document Owner:** [Name and title of the person responsible for maintaining this document]
* **Purpose of Document:** [Briefly state the purpose of the BRD â€“ to define the business requirements for the data science project.]

## 2. Business Problem Definition
* **2.1. Problem Statement (Refined):** [The refined, SMART problem statement developed during the Business Understanding stage.  This should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.]
    *   *Example:* "Reduce churn of premium-tier customers by 15% within the next two quarters."
* **2.2. Background and Context:** [Detailed explanation of the business problem, including historical context, symptoms, and impact.  Include insights gathered from interviews with domain experts and end-users.]
    * *Example:* "Customer churn has been increasing steadily over the past six months, particularly among our premium-tier subscribers.  This is negatively impacting revenue, increasing customer acquisition costs, and eroding our market share.  Competitor analysis suggests that our pricing and feature set may no longer be as competitive as they once were.  Additionally, customer feedback indicates dissatisfaction with certain aspects of our service."
* **2.3. Root Cause Analysis (Preliminary):** [Initial hypotheses about the root causes of the problem, based on discussions with stakeholders and preliminary data exploration.]
    * *Example:* "Possible contributing factors to churn include: pricing, competitor offerings, product features, customer service quality, and lack of engagement with the platform."
* **2.4. Stakeholders affected:** Description of the impact the problem has on different departments and roles within the company.

## 3. Project Objectives and Scope
* **3.1. Project Objectives (SMART):** [List of specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound project objectives. These should be aligned with the problem statement.]
    * *Example 1:* "Develop a predictive model that identifies customers at high risk of churn (premium tier) with at least 80% accuracy within the next three months."
    * *Example 2:* "Provide the customer success team with a weekly prioritized list of at-risk customers, enabling proactive outreach and intervention."
* **3.2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** [List the metrics that will be used to measure the success of the project.]
    * *Example:* "Model Accuracy (on test data), Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC"
    * *Example:* "Churn Rate Reduction (premium tier)"
    * *Example:* "Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Increase"
* **3.3. Scope:**
    * **3.3.1. In Scope:** [Detailed list of what is included in the project.]
    * **3.3.2. Out of Scope:** [Detailed list of what is *not* included in the project.]

## 4. Business Requirements

* **4.1. Functional Requirements:** [Describe the *capabilities* the solution must have from a *business* perspective.  Focus on *what* the solution needs to do, not *how* it will do it. Use clear, concise language.]
    * *Example 1:* "The solution must generate a prioritized list of customers at high risk of churn, ranked by their probability of churning."
    * *Example 2:* "The solution must provide insights into the key factors driving churn for each at-risk customer."
    * *Example 3:* "The solution must allow the customer success team to easily access and view the list of at-risk customers."
    * *Example 4:* "The solution must integrate with existing reporting dashboards (specify which dashboards)."
    * *Example 5* "The solution must allow authorized users to segment the customer list."
    * *Each requirement should have a unique ID for easy reference (e.g., FR-001, FR-002).*
