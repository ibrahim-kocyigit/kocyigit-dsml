    *   **Security Groups:** [Describe any security groups or access control lists.]

## 5. Deployment Steps

*   [Provide a detailed, step-by-step guide to deploying the model. This should be specific enough that someone else could reproduce the deployment.]
    *   **Example (for a Flask API deployed with Docker):**
        1.  Clone the project repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
        2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project directory]`
        3.  Build the Docker image: `docker build -t [image name]:[tag] .`
        4.  Run the Docker container: `docker run -p [host port]:[container port] [image name]:[tag]`
        5.  Verify that the API is running by sending a test request: `curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"feature1": 1, "feature2": 2, ...}' [API URL]/predict`
    *   **Example (for batch prediction):**
        1.  Set up a cron job (or equivalent) to run the `batch_prediction.py` script daily at 3:00 AM.
        2.  Ensure that the `batch_prediction.py` script has execute permissions.
        3.  Configure the script to load the model from `[model path]` and read data from `[data path]`.
        4.  Configure the script to save predictions to `[output path]`.
*   **Include all necessary commands, scripts, and configuration files.**

## 6. Monitoring and Maintenance

*   **6.1. Monitoring Procedures:**
    *   Describe how the model's performance will be monitored in production.
    *   List the specific metrics that will be tracked.
    *   Specify the frequency of monitoring.
    *   Describe how to access monitoring dashboards or reports.
*   **6.2. Alerting:**
    *   Describe the alerting system (if any).
    *   List the conditions that will trigger alerts (e.g., performance degradation below a threshold, data drift).
    *   Specify who will receive the alerts.
*   **6.3. Retraining:**
    *   Describe the model retraining process.
    *   Specify the frequency of retraining (e.g., scheduled, triggered by performance degradation).
    *   Describe how new data will be collected and used for retraining.
*   **6.4. Rollback Procedures:**
    *   Describe the steps to roll back to a previous version of the model in case of failure or performance issues.
