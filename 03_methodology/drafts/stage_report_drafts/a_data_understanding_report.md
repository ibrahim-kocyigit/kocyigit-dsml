# Data Understanding Report

## 1. Introduction

*   **Project Name:** [Project Name - e.g., Customer Churn Prediction]
*   **Date:** [Date of report creation/last update]
*   **Version:** [Version number, e.g., 1.0]
*   **Author(s):** [Name(s) and title(s) of the report author(s)]
*   **Purpose of Document:** Briefly describe the purpose of this report â€“ to summarize the findings of the Data Understanding stage, including data quality assessment, descriptive statistics, visualizations, and initial insights.

## 2. Data Overview

*   **Data Sources:** Briefly list the data sources used.  Refer to the Data Requirements Specification Document for details.
*   **Data Collection Period:**  Specify the time period covered by the data.
*   **Number of Records:** State the number of rows (observations) in the dataset.
*   **Number of Variables:** State the number of columns (features) in the dataset.
*   **Data Types:** Briefly summarize the data types present (e.g., numerical, categorical, date/time).

## 3. Data Quality Assessment

*   **3.1. Missing Values:**
    *   Report the number and percentage of missing values for each column.
    *   Include visualizations of missing data patterns (if applicable, e.g., using `missingno`).
    *   Discuss the potential impact of missing values on the analysis.
*   **3.2. Duplicate Rows:**
    *   Report the number of duplicate rows (if any).
    *   Describe how duplicates were handled (e.g., removed).
*   **3.3. Outliers:**
    *   Describe the methods used to identify outliers (e.g., box plots, Z-scores, IQR).
    *   Report any significant outliers found.
    *   Discuss the potential impact of outliers and how they will be handled (or why they will be kept).
*   **3.4. Inconsistent Data:**
    *   Report any inconsistencies found in categorical variables (e.g., different spellings, capitalization issues).
    *   Describe how inconsistencies were addressed.
*   **3.5. Data Type Issues:**
    *   Report any instances where data types were incorrect or inappropriate.
    *   Describe how data types were corrected.
*   **3.6. Overall Data Quality Summary:**  Provide a brief overall assessment of the data quality.

## 4. Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations

*   **4.1. Numerical Features:**
    *   Include tables of descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, quartiles) for key numerical features.
    *   Include histograms, box plots, and/or density plots to visualize the distribution of key numerical features.
    *   Discuss any notable observations (e.g., skewness, multi-modality, outliers).
*   **4.2. Categorical Features:**
    *   Include tables of frequency counts (or proportions) for key categorical features.
    *   Include bar charts or count plots to visualize the distribution of key categorical features.
    *   Discuss any notable observations (e.g., class imbalance).
*   **4.3. Relationships Between Variables:**
    *   Include scatter plots, grouped box plots, or other relevant visualizations to explore relationships between key variables.
    *   Include a correlation heatmap for numerical features.
    *   Discuss any significant relationships or patterns observed.

## 5. Initial Insights and Patterns

*   [Summarize any key insights or patterns discovered during the Data Understanding stage. This should relate back to the business problem.]
    *   *Example:* "We observed a strong positive correlation between monthly usage and customer lifetime value."
    *   *Example:* "Customers on the 'Basic' plan have a significantly higher churn rate than customers on the 'Premium' plan."
    *   *Example:* "The distribution of customer ages is bimodal, suggesting two distinct customer segments."
*   [Formulate any initial hypotheses based on your findings.]

## 6. Data Gaps and Refinements to Data Requirements

*   **6.1. Data Gaps:** [List any data gaps identified.  Are there any important variables that are missing or incomplete?]
*   **6.2. Refined Data Requirements:** [If any changes to the data requirements are needed, describe them here.  This might involve identifying new data sources, revising the scope of data collection, or modifying data definitions.]
*   **6.3 Next Steps:** [Recommendations to the next step, whether to revise the data requirements, collect additional data or proceed to the data preparation.]

## 7. Conclusion

*   [Provide a brief concluding summary of the Data Understanding findings and their implications for the project.]
* State if the project should process, or revisit previous stages.

## 8. Appendix (Optional)

*   [Include any additional tables, figures, or code that support your findings but are not essential for the main body of the report.]
