# Analytic Approach Report

## 1. Introduction

*   **Project Name:** [Project Name - e.g., Customer Churn Prediction]
*   **Date:** [Date of creation/last update]
*   **Version:** [Version number, e.g., 1.0]
*   **Document Owner:** [Name and title of the person responsible for maintaining this document]

## 2. Business Problem Summary

*   **Brief Recap:** Briefly reiterate the business problem and project objectives (from the Project Charter and BRD).  This provides context for the chosen analytic approach.
    *   *Example:* "The goal of this project is to reduce churn among premium-tier customers by 15% within the next two quarters.  To achieve this, we will develop a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churn, allowing for proactive intervention."

## 3. Problem Framing

*   **3.1. Problem Type:** [State the specific data science problem type.]
    *   *Example:* "This is a **binary classification** problem. We are trying to predict a categorical outcome: whether a customer will churn (Yes/No) or not churn."
*   **3.2. Target Variable:** [Clearly define the target variable.]
    *   *Example:* "The target variable is `churn`, a binary variable where 1 indicates churn and 0 indicates no churn."
*   **3.3. Potential Input Features (Initial List):** [List the potential features (independent variables) that will be considered, based on the Business Understanding stage and domain knowledge.]
    *   *Example:*
        *   `customer_id`
        *   `subscription_start_date`
        *   `plan_type`
        *   `monthly_fee`
        *   `total_usage`
        *   `customer_service_interactions`
        *   `age`
        *   `geographic_location`
        *   ... (list all potential features)

## 4. Proposed Analytic Approach

*   **4.1. Selected Technique(s):** [Name the specific machine learning or statistical technique(s) you plan to use.]
    *   *Example:* "We will primarily use **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (specifically, XGBoost)** for this classification problem."
    *   *Example (Multiple Techniques):* "We will evaluate several algorithms, including **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**, and compare their performance."
*   **4.2. Rationale:** [Explain *why* you chose the selected technique(s). Justify your choice based on the problem type, data characteristics, interpretability requirements, etc.]
    *   *Example (XGBoost):* "XGBoost is a highly accurate and efficient algorithm that is well-suited for classification problems with a mix of numerical and categorical features. It is also relatively robust to outliers and can handle missing values.  While less inherently interpretable than logistic regression, techniques like SHAP values can be used to explain XGBoost predictions."
    *   *Example (Logistic Regression):* "Logistic Regression will be used as a baseline model due to its simplicity and interpretability.  It will help us understand the relationship between individual features and the probability of churn."
*   **4.3. Software and Libraries:** [Specify the software and libraries you will use.]
    *   *Example:* "The model will be developed in Python using the following libraries: scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization."
*   **4.4 Alternative Techniques Considered:** List other methods considered during model selection and reasoning for main selection.

## 5. Assumptions and Limitations

*   **5.1. Assumptions:** [List any assumptions made about the data or the problem.]
    *   *Example:* "We assume that the historical data is representative of future customer behavior."
    *   *Example:* "We assume that the available features capture the most important drivers of churn."
*   **5.2. Limitations:** [Acknowledge any potential limitations of the chosen approach.]
    *   *Example:* "XGBoost models can be less interpretable than simpler models like logistic regression."
    *   *Example:* "The model's accuracy may be limited by the quality and completeness of the available data."
    *   *Example:* "The model may not be able to predict churn caused by unforeseen external factors (e.g., a major economic downturn)."

## 6. Evaluation Metrics

*   **Primary Metric(s):** [Specify the primary metric(s) that will be used to evaluate model performance.  This should align with the project objectives and KPIs defined in the Business Understanding stage.]
    *   *Example (Classification):* "The primary evaluation metrics will be **AUC-ROC** and **F1-score**.  We will also monitor precision and recall."
    *   *Example (Regression):* "The primary evaluation metric will be **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**. We will also monitor MAE and R-squared."
*   **Target Performance:** [If possible, specify a target value or range for the primary metric(s). This helps define what constitutes a "successful" model.]
    * *Example:* "The target AUC-ROC is 0.8 or higher."
    *   *Example:* "We aim to achieve an RMSE of less than X [units]."

## 7. Potential Challenges

*   [List any potential challenges or obstacles that could impact the project.]
    *   *Example:* "Data quality issues (e.g., missing values, inconsistent data) could impact model performance."
    *   *Example:* "Feature engineering may be complex and require significant domain expertise."
    *   *Example:* "The dataset may be highly imbalanced (e.g., many more non-churners than churners), requiring special techniques to address."
