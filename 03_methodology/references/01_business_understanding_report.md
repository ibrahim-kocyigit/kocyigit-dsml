# Business Understanding Report

## Business Problem
_Based on the initial meeting(s), formulate a clear and concise statement of the business problem. Focus on what the business needs to achieve. Distill the core issue._

## Project Objectives
_Translate the business problem into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) project objectives. What specific outcomes will constitute success from a business perspective?_

## Solution Requirements
_Outline the high-level requirements for the analytic solution from a business perspective. What are the essential functionalities, constraints, and performance expectations (e.g., accuracy, speed, interpretability)? This doesn't need to be deeply technical at this stage, but it should guide the analytic approach._
