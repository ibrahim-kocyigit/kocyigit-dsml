# Stage 1: Business Understanding
_"Every project starts with business understanding. The business sponsors who need the analytic solution play the most critical role in this stage by defining the problem, project objectives and solution requirements from a business perspective. This first stage lays the foundation for a successful resolution of the business problem. To help guarantee the project's success, the sponsors should be involved throughout the project to provide the domain expertise, review intermediate findings and ensure the work remains on track to generate the intended solution."_ - **John B. Rollins**

## Step 1: Initial Meeting & Information Gathering
Schedule and attend an initial meeting with the business sponsors/project stakeholders. Ask clarifying questions to understand their objectives, the business problem they are trying to solve, how they currently approach the problem, and any existing solutions. [^1] Take detailed notes and transcribe them into the [Business Understanding Report]('./state-report-templates/01_business_understanding_report.md').

## Step 2: Define the Business Problem
Based on the initial meeting(s), formulate a clear and concise statement of the business problem. Focus on what the business needs to achieve. Distill the core issue. Transcribe the business problem into the Business Understanding Report.

## Step 3: Define Project Objectives 
Translate the business problem into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) project objectives. What specific outcomes will constitute success from a business perspective? Transcribe the project objectives into the Business Understanding Report.

## Step 4: Define Solution Requirements
Outline the high-level requirements for the analytic solution from a business perspective. What are the essential functionalities, constraints, and performance expectations (e.g., accuracy, speed, interpretability)? This doesn't need to be deeply technical at this stage, but it should guide the analytic approach. Transcribe the solution requirements into the Business Understanding Report.

## Step 5: Documentation, Validation, and Iterative Alignment
* Prepare the final draft of the Business Understanding Report.
* Distribute the report to business sponsors for thorough review and validation, specifically requesting feedback on the problem statement, objectives, and requirements.
* Implement feedback through iterative revisions, facilitating a collaborative process to achieve a clear, validated, and mutually agreed-upon understanding.
