# Stage 1: Business Understanding
_"Every project starts with business understanding. The business sponsors who need the analytic solution play the most critical role in this stage by defining the problem, project objectives and solution requirements from a business perspective. This first stage lays the foundation for a successful resolution of the business problem. To help guarantee the projectâ€™s success, the sponsors should be involved throughout the project to provide domain expertise, review intermediate findings and ensure the work remains on track to generate the intended solution."_ - **John B. Rollins**

## Step 1: Initial Meeting & Information Gathering
Schedule and attend an initial meeting with the business sponsors/project stakeholders. Ask clarifying questions to understand their objectives, the business problem they are trying to solve, how they currently approach the problem, and any existing solutions. Take detailed notes.

## Step 2: Define the Business Problem
Based on the initial meeting(s), formulate a clear and concise statement of the business problem. Focus on what the business needs to achieve. Distill the core issue.

## Step 3: Define Project Objectives
Translate the business problem into specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) project objectives. What specific outcomes will constitute success from a business perspective?

## Step 4: Define Solution Requirements
Outline the high-level requirements for the analytic solution from a business perspective. What are the essential functionalities, constraints, and performance expectations (e.g., accuracy, speed, interpretability)? This doesn't need to be deeply technical at this stage, but it should guide the analytic approach.

## Step 5: Document and Get Feedback
Get your information from the meetings, and put them into documents. Share your understandings and documentation with the business sponsors to ensure alignment and get their feedback. Iterate on the problem statement, objectives, and requirements until they are clear and agreed upon.
