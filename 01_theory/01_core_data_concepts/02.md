### Course Notes: Measures of Central Tendency

#### **1. Introduction to Measures of Center**
- **Objective**: To understand and calculate the center of a dataset.
- **Common Measures**: Mean, Median, and Mode.

---

#### **2. Mean (Arithmetic Mean)**
- **Definition**: The most common measure of center, often referred to as the "average."
- **Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}
  $$
  - **$\sum$ (Sigma)**: Summation symbol, meaning "add up all values."
  - **$x_i$**: Represents each data point in the dataset.
  - **$n$**: Total number of data points.

- **Steps to Calculate**:
  1. Add up all the values in the dataset.
  2. Divide the sum by the number of data points.

- **Example**:
  - Dataset: $[1, 2, 4, 6, 7]$
  - Sum: $1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 7 = 20$
  - Mean: $20 \div 5 = 4$

- **Notation**:
  - **Population Mean ($\mu$)**: Used when the dataset represents the entire population.
  - **Sample Mean ($\bar{x}$)**: Used when the dataset is a sample of the population.

#### **3. Weighted Mean**
- **Use Case**: When data points have different weights or importance.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  \text{Weighted Mean} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \cdot x_i)}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}
  $$
  - **$w_i$**: Weight of each data point.
  - **$x_i$**: Value of each data point.

- **Example**:
  - Dataset: Department satisfaction scores with varying department sizes.
  - Calculation: Multiply each score by its department size, sum the products, and divide by the total number of employees.

#### **4. Truncated Mean**
- **Use Case**: When outliers are present in the dataset.
- **Steps**:
  1. Remove a percentage of the highest and lowest values.
  2. Calculate the mean of the remaining data.
- **Example**:
  - Dataset: $[16, 18, 21, 27, 32, 33, 91]$
  - Remove the highest (91) and lowest (16) values.
  - Calculate the mean of the remaining values: $[18, 21, 27, 32, 33]$.

- **Caution**: Always communicate when data has been truncated to avoid misinterpretation.

---

#### **5. Mode**
- **Definition**: The value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.
- **Types**:
  - **Unimodal**: One mode.
  - **Bimodal**: Two modes.
  - **No Mode**: All values occur with the same frequency.

- **Example**:
  - Dataset: $[16, 18, 21, 27, 32, 32, 33]$
  - Mode: $32$ (occurs twice).

---

#### **6. Median**
- **Definition**: The middle value of an ordered dataset.
- **Steps to Calculate**:
  1. Arrange the data in ascending or descending order.
  2. Identify the middle value:
     - If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value.
     - If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.

- **Example**:
  - Dataset: $[16, 18, 21, 27, 32, 33]$
  - Median: $(21 + 27) \div 2 = 24$

---

#### **7. Choosing the Right Measure of Central Tendency**
- **Factors to Consider**:
  1. **Type of Data**:
     - **Numeric vs. Non-Numeric**: Mean and median require numeric data; mode can be used for non-numeric data.
     - **Continuous vs. Discrete**: Mean is suitable for both, but median is often preferred for skewed data.
     - **Nominal vs. Ordinal**: Median and mode are appropriate for ordinal data; mode is the only option for nominal data.

  2. **Presence of Outliers**:
     - **Mean**: Sensitive to outliers.
     - **Median**: Robust against outliers.
     - **Mode**: Unaffected by outliers.

  3. **Context of the Data**:
     - **Example**: Median is often used for income data to avoid skewing by extreme values.

---

#### **8. Practical Applications**
- **Mean**:
  - Used for symmetric datasets without outliers.
  - Example: Average height of a group of people.

- **Median**:
  - Used for skewed datasets or datasets with outliers.
  - Example: Median household income.

- **Mode**:
  - Used for categorical data or identifying the most common value.
  - Example: Most common pet in a household.

---

#### **9. Summary**
- **Mean**: Best for symmetric, numeric data without outliers.
- **Median**: Best for skewed data or data with outliers.
- **Mode**: Best for categorical or non-numeric data.

- **Key Takeaway**: Always consider the type of data and the presence of outliers when choosing a measure of central tendency.

#### **10. Practice Questions**
1. Calculate the mean, median, and mode for the dataset: $[5, 7, 8, 8, 10, 12]$.
2. Explain why the median is preferred over the mean for income data.
3. Given the dataset $[3, 5, 7, 7, 9, 11, 11, 11]$, identify the mode and explain whether the dataset is unimodal or bimodal.

---

#### **11. Additional Notes**
- **Weighted Mean**: Useful when data points have different levels of importance.
- **Truncated Mean**: Useful for datasets with extreme outliers.
- **Bimodal Data**: Indicates two distinct peaks in the data distribution.

By understanding these measures of central tendency, you can effectively summarize and interpret data in various contexts.
