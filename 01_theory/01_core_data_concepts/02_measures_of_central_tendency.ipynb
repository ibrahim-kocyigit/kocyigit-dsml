    "# Measures of Central Tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "We use measures of central tendency to understand and calculate the center of a dataset. The most commonly used measures of central tendency are mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Mean (Arithmetic Mean)\n",
    "**Definition:** The most common measure of center. Often referred to as the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **$\\sum$ (Sigma)**: Summation symbol, meaning \"add up all values.\"\n",
    "- **$x_i$**: Represents each data point in the dataset.\n",
    "- **$n$**: Total number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Calculate**:\n",
    "1. Add up all the values in the dataset.\n",
    "2. Divide the sum by the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Dataset: $[1, 2, 4, 6, 7]$\n",
    "- Sum: $1 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 7 = 20$\n",
    "- Mean: $20 \\div 5 = 4$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notation:**\n",
    "- **Population Mean ($\\mu$)**: Used when the dataset represents the entire population.\n",
    "- **Sample Mean ($\\bar{x}$)**: Used when the dataset is a sample of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Weighted Mean\n",
    "**Use Case:** When data points have different weights or importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\text{Weighted Mean} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (w_i \\cdot x_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}\n",
    "$\n",
    "- **$w_i$**: Weight of each data point.\n",
    "- **$x_i$**: Value of each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Dataset: Department satisfaction scores with varying department sizes.\n",
    "- Calculation: Multiply each score by its department size, sum the products, and divide by the total number of employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Truncated Mean\n",
    "**Use Case:** When outliers are present in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Remove a percentage of the highest and lowest values.\n",
    "2. Calculate the mean of the remaining data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Dataset: $[16, 18, 21, 27, 32, 33, 91]$\n",
    "- Remove the highest (91) and lowest (16) values.\n",
    "- Calculate the mean of the remaining values: $[18, 21, 27, 32, 33]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution:** Always communicate when data has been truncated to avoid misinterpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Mode\n",
    "**Definition:** The value that occurs most frequently in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types:**\n",
    "- **Unimodal:** One mode.\n",
    "- **Bimodal:** Two modes. Indicates two distinct peaks in the data distribution.\n",
    "- **No Mode:** All values occur with the same frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Dataset: $[16, 18, 21, 27, 32, 32, 33]$\n",
    "- Mode: $32$ (occurs twice).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Median\n",
    "- **Definition**: The middle value of an ordered dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps to Calculate:**\n",
    "1. Arrange the data in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "2. Identify the middle value:\n",
    "    - If the dataset has an odd number of values, the median is the middle value.\n",
    "    - If the dataset has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Dataset: $[16, 18, 21, 27, 32, 33]$\n",
    "- Median: $(21 + 27) \\div 2 = 24$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Choosing the Right Measure of Central Tendency\n",
    "**Factors to Consider:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Type of Data:**\n",
    "    - **Numeric vs. Non-Numeric**: Mean and median require numeric data; mode can be used for non-numeric data.\n",
    "    - **Continuous vs. Discrete**: Mean is suitable for both, but median is often preferred for skewed data.\n",
    "    - **Nominal vs. Ordinal**: Median and mode are appropriate for ordinal data; mode is the only option for nominal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Presence of Outliers:**\n",
    "    - **Mean**: Sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "    - **Median**: Robust against outliers.\n",
    "    - **Mode**: Unaffected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Context of the Data:**\n",
    "    - **Example**: Median is often used for income data to avoid skewing by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Applications**\n",
    "**Mean:**\n",
    "- Used for symmetric datasets without outliers.\n",
    "- Example: Average height of a group of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted Mean**\n",
    "- Useful when data points have different levels of importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Truncated Mean**\n",
    "- Useful for datasets with extreme outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Median:**\n",
    "- Used for skewed datasets or datasets with outliers.\n",
    "- Example: Median household income.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mode:**\n",
    "- Used for categorical data or identifying the most common value.\n",
    "- Example: Most common pet in a household."
