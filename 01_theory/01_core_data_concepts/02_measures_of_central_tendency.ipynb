    "\n",
    "Measures of central tendency are single values that attempt to describe the \"center\" or \"typical\" value of a dataset. They provide a summary statistic that represents the central point around which the data tends to cluster.\n",

    "We can use measures of central tendency to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Summarize Data:** Providing a concise description of a dataset's typical value.\n",
    "* **Compare Datasets:** Comparing the centers of different datasets to see if they differ significantly.\n",
    "* **Understand Distributions:** Helping to understand the shape and characteristics of a data distribution.\n",
    "* **Make Predictions:** Using the central tendency as a simple prediction for future values (though this is often too simplistic).\n",
