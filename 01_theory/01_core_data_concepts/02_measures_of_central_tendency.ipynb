    "# Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of central tendency are single values that attempt to describe the \"center\" or \"typical\" value of a dataset. They provide a summary statistic that represents the central point around which the data tends to cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use measures of central tendency to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Summarize Data:** Providing a concise description of a dataset's typical value.\n",
    "* **Compare Datasets:** Comparing the centers of different datasets to see if they differ significantly.\n",
    "* **Understand Distributions:** Helping to understand the shape and characteristics of a data distribution.\n",
    "* **Make Predictions:** Using the central tendency as a simple prediction for future values (though this is often too simplistic).\n",
    "* **Analyze Data:** Understanding central values before processing.\n",

    "## Mean (Arithmetic Mean, Average)\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean is the sum of all values divided by the number of values. Its best use case is for data that is *symmetrically distributed* (like a bell curve) and *doesn't have extreme outliers*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean uses all data points, which means it's mathematically convenient, **however** it's *sensitive to outliers* (extreme values can drastically pull the mean away from the \"true\" center).\n",

    "$\\mu = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}$\n",

    "* $μ$ (mu): Population mean\n",

    "* $N$: Total number of data points in the population\n",
