    "## 1. What is Linear Algebra?\n",
    "Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics that deals with **vectors**, **matrices**, and **linear transformations**. It is foundational to machine learning and is used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Representation:** Data is often represented as vectors (for individual data points) or matrices (for datasets).\n",
    "- **Transformations:** Linear algebra is used to rotate, scale, and project data.\n",
    "- **Algorithms:** Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and neural networks rely heavily on linear algebra.\n",

    "### Scalars\n",
    "A **scalar** is a single number (e.g., 5, -3.2, Ï€). Scalars are used to represent quantities like weights, biases, and learning rates in machine learning.\n",

    "### Vectors\n",
    "A **vector** is an ordered list of numbers. For example:\n",
