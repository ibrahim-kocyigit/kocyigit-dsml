# Step 1: Import NumPy
# Import the NumPy library here.

# Your code here

# Step 2: Define Scalars
# Define two scalars, a and b, with values 5 and 3, respectively.

# Your code here

# Step 3: Create Vectors
# Create two vectors, u and v, each with 3 elements:
# u = [1, 2, 3]
# v = [4, 5, 6]

# Your code here

# Step 4: Vector Addition
# Add the two vectors u and v element-wise.

# Your code here

# Step 5: Scalar Multiplication
# Multiply the vector u by the scalar a.

# Your code here

# Step 6: Create Matrices
# Create two matrices, A and B, with the following values:
# A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
# B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]

# Your code here

# Step 7: Matrix Addition
# Add the two matrices A and B element-wise.

# Your code here

# Step 8: Scalar Multiplication of Matrices
# Multiply the matrix A by the scalar b.

# Your code here

# Step 9: Real-World Example - Feature Scaling
# Create a dataset of house features with the following values:
# Size (in square meters): [150, 120, 200]
# Number of bedrooms: [3, 2, 4]
# Age (in years): [10, 20, 5]

# Your code here

# Step 10: Scale the Size and Age Features
# Scale the Size and Age features to the range [0, 1] using the formula:
# x_scaled = (x - x_min) / (x_max - x_min)

# Your code here

# Step 11: Print Results
# Print the results of all operations to verify your implementation.

# Your code here

# Bonus: Write a function for scaling
