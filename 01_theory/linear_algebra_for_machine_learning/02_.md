Got it! Let’s move on to **Lesson 2: Vector Operations**. In this lesson, we’ll explore key vector operations such as the **dot product**, **cross product**, and **vector norms**. These concepts are fundamental to linear algebra and have wide applications in machine learning, physics, and engineering.

## Lesson 2: Vector Operations

### 1. Dot Product
The **dot product** (or scalar product) of two vectors is a single number obtained by multiplying corresponding elements and summing the results. For vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), the dot product is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \dots + u_n v_n
$$

#### Properties of the Dot Product:
- **Commutative:** \( \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u} \)
- **Distributive:** \( \mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w} \)
- **Geometric Interpretation:** The dot product measures the similarity between two vectors. If the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular).

#### Python Implementation:
```python
import numpy as np

u = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v = np.array([4, 5, 6])

dot_product = np.dot(u, v)
print("Dot Product:", dot_product)
```

### 2. Cross Product
The **cross product** (or vector product) of two vectors is a vector that is perpendicular to both input vectors. For 3D vectors \( \mathbf{u} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \), the cross product is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\
u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\
u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

#### Properties of the Cross Product:
- **Anti-Commutative:** \( \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u}) \)
- **Geometric Interpretation:** The magnitude of the cross product is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors.

#### Python Implementation:
```python
cross_product = np.cross(u, v)
print("Cross Product:", cross_product)
```

---

### 3. Vector Norms
The **norm** of a vector measures its length or magnitude. The most common norm is the **Euclidean norm** (L2 norm), defined as:

$$
\|\mathbf{u}\|_2 = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \dots + u_n^2}
$$

Other common norms include:
- **L1 Norm:** \( \|\mathbf{u}\|_1 = |u_1| + |u_2| + \dots + |u_n| \)
- **L∞ Norm:** \( \|\mathbf{u}\|_\infty = \max(|u_1|, |u_2|, \dots, |u_n|) \)

#### Python Implementation:
```python
# Euclidean norm (L2 norm)
l2_norm = np.linalg.norm(u)
print("L2 Norm of u:", l2_norm)

# L1 norm
l1_norm = np.linalg.norm(u, ord=1)
print("L1 Norm of u:", l1_norm)

# L∞ norm
linf_norm = np.linalg.norm(u, ord=np.inf)
print("L∞ Norm of u:", linf_norm)
```

---

### 4. Unit Vectors
A **unit vector** is a vector with a magnitude of 1. You can normalize a vector by dividing it by its norm:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{u}} = \frac{\mathbf{u}}{\|\mathbf{u}\|}
$$

#### Python Implementation:
```python
unit_vector = u / np.linalg.norm(u)
print("Unit Vector of u:", unit_vector)
```

---

### 5. Real-World Example: Cosine Similarity
**Cosine similarity** measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which indicates how similar they are. It is defined as:

$$
\text{cosine similarity} = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\| \|\mathbf{v}\|}
$$

#### Python Implementation:
```python
def cosine_similarity(u: np.ndarray, v: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    Computes the cosine similarity between two vectors.

    Parameters:
    u (numpy.ndarray): The first vector.
    v (numpy.ndarray): The second vector.

    Returns:
    float: The cosine similarity between u and v.
    """
    dot_product = np.dot(u, v)
    norm_u = np.linalg.norm(u)
    norm_v = np.linalg.norm(v)
    return dot_product / (norm_u * norm_v)

# Example usage
u = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v = np.array([4, 5, 6])
similarity = cosine_similarity(u, v)
print("Cosine Similarity:", similarity)
```

### Summary of Lesson 2
- **Dot Product:** Measures the similarity between two vectors.
- **Cross Product:** Produces a vector perpendicular to both input vectors.
- **Vector Norms:** Measure the magnitude of a vector (e.g., L2 norm for Euclidean length).
- **Unit Vectors:** Vectors with a magnitude of 1, obtained by normalization.
- **Cosine Similarity:** Measures the similarity between two vectors using the cosine of the angle between them.
