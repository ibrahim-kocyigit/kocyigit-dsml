# Vector Operations

## 1. Dot Product
The **dot product** (or scalar product) of two vectors is a single number obtained by multiplying corresponding elements and summing the results. For vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, the dot product is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \dots + u_n v_n
$$

### Properties of the Dot Product:
- **Commutative:** $\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{u}$
- **Distributive:** $\mathbf{u} \cdot (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w}$
- **Geometric Interpretation:** The dot product measures the similarity between two vectors. If the dot product is zero, the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular).

### Python Implementation:
```python
import numpy as np

u = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v = np.array([4, 5, 6])

dot_product = np.dot(u, v)
print("Dot Product:", dot_product)
```

## 2. Cross Product
The **cross product** (or vector product) of two vectors is a vector that is perpendicular to both input vectors. For 3D vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$, the cross product is defined as:

$$
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix}
u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2 \\
u_3 v_1 - u_1 v_3 \\
u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Properties of the Cross Product:
- **Anti-Commutative:** $\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = -(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{u})$
- **Geometric Interpretation:** The magnitude of the cross product is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors.

### Python Implementation:
```python
cross_product = np.cross(u, v)
print("Cross Product:", cross_product)
```

## 3. Vector Norms
The **norm** of a vector measures its length or magnitude. The most common norm is the **Euclidean norm** (L2 norm), defined as:

$$
\|\mathbf{u}\|_2 = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + \dots + u_n^2}
$$

Other common norms include:
- **L1 Norm:** $\|\mathbf{u}\|_1 = |u_1| + |u_2| + \dots + |u_n|$
- **L∞ Norm:** $\|\mathbf{u}\|_\infty = \max(|u_1|, |u_2|, \dots, |u_n|)$

### Python Implementation:
```python
# Euclidean norm (L2 norm)
l2_norm = np.linalg.norm(u)
print("L2 Norm of u:", l2_norm)

# L1 norm
l1_norm = np.linalg.norm(u, ord=1)
print("L1 Norm of u:", l1_norm)

# L∞ norm
linf_norm = np.linalg.norm(u, ord=np.inf)
print("L∞ Norm of u:", linf_norm)
```

## 4. Unit Vectors
A **unit vector** is a vector with a magnitude of 1. You can normalize a vector by dividing it by its norm:

$$
\hat{\mathbf{u}} = \frac{\mathbf{u}}{\|\mathbf{u}\|}
$$

### Python Implementation:
```python
unit_vector = u / np.linalg.norm(u)
print("Unit Vector of u:", unit_vector)
```

## 5. Real-World Example: Cosine Similarity
**Cosine similarity** measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors, which indicates how similar they are. It is defined as:

$$
\text{cosine similarity} = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\| \|\mathbf{v}\|}
$$

### Python Implementation:
```python
def cosine_similarity(u: np.ndarray, v: np.ndarray) -> float:
    """
    Computes the cosine similarity between two vectors.

    Parameters:
    u (numpy.ndarray): The first vector.
    v (numpy.ndarray): The second vector.

    Returns:
    float: The cosine similarity between u and v.
    """
    dot_product = np.dot(u, v)
    norm_u = np.linalg.norm(u)
    norm_v = np.linalg.norm(v)
    return dot_product / (norm_u * norm_v)

# Example usage
u = np.array([1, 2, 3])
v = np.array([4, 5, 6])
similarity = cosine_similarity(u, v)
print("Cosine Similarity:", similarity)
```
