    "# Vector Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we will examine more advanced operations on vectors. We will focus on the concepts of **dot product**, **vector norms**, and **cosine similarity**, which are frequently used in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Dot Product\n",
    "The **dot product** is the sum of the products of the corresponding elements of two vectors. This operation helps us to understand the relationship between two vectors. It allows us to answer questions like, \"_To what extent do two vectors point in the same direction?\"_ or _\"What is the angle between two vectors?\"_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\\\ u_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ u_n \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ v_n \\end{bmatrix}$ be two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dot product of these two vectors is denoted as $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}$ or $\\mathbf{u}^T\\mathbf{v}$ and is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = u_1v_1 + u_2v_2 + \\dots + u_nv_n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i v_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:** \n",
    "* For the dot product to be defined, the two vectors must have the same dimension (the same number of elements).\n",
    "* The dot product is **commutative**. This means the order of the vectors doesn't matter: u⋅v = v⋅u.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Geometric Interpretation of the Dot Product\n",
    "The dot product is related to the cosine of the angle between two vectors. If $\\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = ||\\mathbf{u}|| \\cdot ||\\mathbf{v}|| \\cdot \\cos(\\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $||\\mathbf{u}||$ and $||\\mathbf{v}||$ are the lengths (norms) of vectors $\\mathbf{u}$ and $\\mathbf{v}$, respectively. We will discuss this topic shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0$, the vectors are perpendicular (**orthogonal**).\n",
    "*   If $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} > 0$, the angle between the vectors is acute (they point in a similar direction).\n",
    "*   If $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} < 0$, the angle between the vectors is obtuse (they point in opposite directions).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{bmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 3 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = (2 \\cdot 1) + (-1 \\cdot 4) + (3 \\cdot 0) = 2 - 4 + 0 = -2$\n",
