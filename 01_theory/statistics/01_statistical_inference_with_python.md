# Statistical Inference with Python

## What is Statistical Inference
Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about a population based on a sample of data. It's a powerful tool that allows us to move from observations to generalizations. In the world of machine learning, statistical inference provides the bedrock for:
* Estimating model parameters and quantifying their uncertainty
* Evaluating the performance of machine learning models and making comparisons
* Making predictions on new, unseen data with confidence intervals
* Understanding the underlying relationships between variables.

## Key Concepts and Notation
Before we proceed, let's establish some essential terminology and notation:
* **Population:** The entire collection of individuals or objects about which we want to draw conclusions. We often use Greek letters to denote population parameters such as:
    * µ (mu) for the population mean
    * σ (sigma) for the population standard deviation
    * σ² (sigma squared) for the population variance 
* **Sample:** A subset of the population from which we collect data. Sample statistics are usually denoted with Roman letters:
    * x̄ (x-bar) for the sample mean.
    * s for the sample standard deviation.
    * s² for the sample variance
    * n for the sample size
* **Random Variable:** A variable whose value is numerical outcome of a random phenomenon. We often use uppercase letters (e.g., X, Y) to denote random variables.
* **Probability Distribution:** A function that describes the likelihood of different outcomes for a random variable. Common examples include the normal distribution, binomial distribution, and Poisson distribution. 
* **Sampling Distribution:** The probability of a statistic (e.g., the distribution of sample means from many different samples). This concept is central to understanding how well a sample statistic estimates a population parameter.
