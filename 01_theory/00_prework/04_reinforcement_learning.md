# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) focuses on training an agent to make decisions in an environment to maximize a cumulative reward. Unlike supervised or unsupervised learning, RL learns through interactions and feedback, mimicking how humans and animals learn. Reinforcement learning is based on the following core concepts:

1.  Environment
2.  Agent
3.  State
4.  Action
5.  Reward
6.  Policy
7.  Training
8.  Evaluation

## 1. Environment

The environment is the external world with which the agent interacts. It can be a simulated world (like a video game) or a real-world setting (like a robot navigating a room). The environment provides states and rewards to the agent.

## 2. Agent

The agent is the learner and decision-maker. Its goal is to learn the optimal policy to maximize the cumulative reward.

## 3. State

The state represents the current situation of the environment. It's the information the agent uses to make decisions. For example, in a game, the state might include the positions of all the characters and objects.

## 4. Action

An action is a decision made by the agent that changes the state of the environment. The agent selects actions based on its policy.

## 5. Reward

A reward is a numerical signal that indicates the immediate consequence of an action. Positive rewards reinforce desirable actions, while negative rewards discourage undesirable actions.

## 6. Policy

A policy is the agent's strategy for selecting actions. It maps states to actions. The goal of RL is to learn an optimal policy that maximizes the cumulative reward.

## 7. Training

Training in RL involves the agent interacting with the environment over many episodes. In each episode, the agent takes actions, receives rewards, and updates its policy based on the feedback. The agent learns to associate states with actions that lead to higher rewards.

Here's a simplified view of the training process:

1.  **Agent observes the current state.**
2.  **Agent chooses an action based on its current policy.**
3.  **Agent performs the action in the environment.**
4.  **Environment provides a new state and a reward.**
5.  **Agent updates its policy based on the reward and the new state.**
6.  **Repeat steps 1-5 for many episodes.**

## 8. Evaluation

Evaluating an RL agent involves assessing its performance in the environment after training. This can be done by measuring the cumulative reward the agent achieves over multiple episodes or by comparing its performance to a baseline or expert performance.

Key aspects of evaluation:

* **Cumulative Reward:** The total reward accumulated over an episode or multiple episodes.
* **Episode Length:** The number of steps taken to complete an episode.
* **Success Rate:** The percentage of episodes in which the agent achieves a desired goal.
* **Generalization:** How well the agent performs in unseen environments or variations of the training environment.

Reinforcement learning is particularly useful in scenarios where:

* There is no labeled data.
* The agent must learn through trial and error.
* Decisions have long-term consequences.
* The environment is dynamic and uncertain.

Examples of RL applications include:

* Game playing (e.g., AlphaGo).
* Robotics (e.g., robot navigation).
* Autonomous driving.
* Resource management.
