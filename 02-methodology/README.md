**Note:** The practice section of `kocyigit-ds` does not cover all content from the source. Deciding what to include is subjective — I primarily focus on:

1. **Frequently used code** – Patterns and snippets I rely on regularly.
2. **Documentation-heavy code** – Concepts I often need to revisit in official docs.

For fundamentals (e.g., Python, Pandas, NumPy, or core ML concepts), refer to the cheat sheets instead.
