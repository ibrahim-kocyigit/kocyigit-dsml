# Kocyigit-ML
Kocyigit-ML is an evolving project that consolidates the learning resources I use on my journey to becoming a Machine Learning Engineer. This repository is structured into three key sections:

## 1. Theory:
Comprehensive notes on the mathematical foundations of machine learning, covering calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and probability.

### [Calculus](./01_theory//01_calculus/) (__Ongoing__)
- A structured compilation of my notes from **Khan Academy**’s [Precalculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) (__Completed__), [AP Calculus BC](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc) (__Ongoing__), [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) (__Not Started__), and [Differential Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations) (__Not Started__) courses.



2. **Practice:** Hands-on training materials for applied ML, including Python, SQL, and essential ML libraries.
3. **Methodology:** A structured walkthrough of *John B. Rollins’s 10-Stage Foundational Methodology for Data Science*, providing a systematic approach to real-world ML projects.

This project serves as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for others navigating the ML landscape. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
