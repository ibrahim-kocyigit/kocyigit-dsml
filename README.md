# Kocyigit-ML
Kocyigit-ML is an evolving project that consolidates the learning resources I use on my journey to becoming a Machine Learning Engineer. This repository is structured into three key sections:

1. **Theory:** Comprehensive notes on the mathematical foundations of machine learning, covering calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and probability.
2. **Practice:** Hands-on training materials for applied ML, including Python, SQL, and essential ML libraries.
3. **Methodology:** A structured walkthrough of *John B. Rollins’s 10-Stage Foundational Methodology for Data Science*, providing a systematic approach to real-world ML projects.

This project serves as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for others navigating the ML landscape. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
