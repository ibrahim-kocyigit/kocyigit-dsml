# Kocyigit-ML 🤖 
#### A structured learning repository for mastering Machine Learning fundamentals!

This project consolidates my curated learning resources, organized into three pillars: 

1. **[Theory](./01_theory/)**: Mathematical foundations (calculus, linear algebra, statistics and probability)  
2. **[Application](./02_application/)**: Applied skills (Python, libraries for data science and machine learning)  
3. **[Methodology](./03_methodology/)**: Implementation framework based on Foundational Methodology for Data Science by **John B. Rollins**
