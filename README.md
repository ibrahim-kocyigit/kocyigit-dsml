# Kocyigit-ML
Kocyigit-ML is an evolving project that consolidates the learning resources I use on my journey to becoming a Machine Learning Engineer. This repository is structured into three key sections:

## 1. Theory
Comprehensive notes on the mathematical foundations of machine learning, covering calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and probability.

#### [Calculus](./01_theory//01_calculus/) (_Ongoing_)
A structured compilation of my notes from **Khan Academy**’s [Precalculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) (_Completed_), [AP Calculus BC](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc) (_Ongoing_), [Multivariable Calculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus) (_Not Started_), and [Differential Equations](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/differential-equations) (_Not Started_) courses, covering key concepts, problem-solving techniques, and essential formulas.

#### [Linear Algebra](./01_theory/02_linear_algebra/) (_Complete_)
A structured compilation of my notes from **Krista King**'s [Become a Linear Algebra Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-course/) course, covering key concepts, problem-solving techniques, and essential formulas.

#### [Statistics and Probability](./01_theory/03_statistics_and_probability/) (_Ongoing_)
A structured compilation of my notes from **Khan Academy**’s [Statistics and Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) course, covering key concepts, problem-solving techniques, and essential formulas.

## 2. Practice
Hands-on training materials for applied ML, including Python, SQL, and essential ML libraries.

### [Python for Beginners](./02_practice/01_python_for_beginners/)(_Ongoing_)
A structured compilation of my notes from **freeCodeCamp.org**’s [Python for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWRfhZUzrAc) course and [pythoncheatsheet.org](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/), covering key concepts.

## 3. Methodology:
A structured walkthrough of *John B. Rollins’s 10-Stage Foundational Methodology for Data Science*, providing a systematic approach to real-world ML projects.
