# Kocyigit-ML
Kocyigit-ML is an evolving project that consolidates the learning resources I use on my journey to becoming a Machine Learning Engineer. This repository is structured into three key sections:

## 1. Theory:
Comprehensive notes on the mathematical foundations of machine learning, covering calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and probability.

### Calculus
- **00_precalculus(Complete):** A structured compilation of my notes from **Khan Academy**’s [Precalculus](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus) course, covering key concepts, problem-solving techniques, and essential formulas.

2. **Practice:** Hands-on training materials for applied ML, including Python, SQL, and essential ML libraries.
3. **Methodology:** A structured walkthrough of *John B. Rollins’s 10-Stage Foundational Methodology for Data Science*, providing a systematic approach to real-world ML projects.

This project serves as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for others navigating the ML landscape. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
