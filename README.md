# Kocyigit-DSML

#### A structured learning repository for mastering Data Science and Machine Learning fundamentals\!

This project consolidates my curated learning resources, organized into five pillars:

1. **[Math](./01_math/)**: The mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning, including Linear Algebra, Calculus, and Statistics & Probability.
2. **[Toolkit](./02_toolkit/)**: The foundational skills for data science, covering core Python programming and its essential libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
3. **[Specializations](./03_specializations/)**: Deep dives into specific data science and machine learning domains, from analysis and inference to building advanced predictive models.
4. **[MLOps](./04_mlops/)**: Tools and methodologies for taking machine learning models to production, including packaging, serving, monitoring, and automation.
5. **[Methodology](./05_methodology/)**: A step-by-step implementation framework for executing data science projects, based on the Foundational Methodology for Data Science by **John B. Rollins**.
