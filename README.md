# Kocyigit-ML 🤖

#### A structured learning repository for mastering Machine Learning fundamentals\!

This project consolidates my curated learning resources, organized into five pillars:

1.  **[Math](./01_math/)**: The mathematical foundations of machine learning, including Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Statistics & Probability.
2.  **[Toolkit](./02_toolkit//)**: The foundational Python libraries for data handling, numerical computation, and visualization, such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
3.  **[Models](./03_models/)**: The implementation and theory of various machine learning models, from classical algorithms with Scikit-Learn to an introduction to Deep Learning with TensorFlow/Keras.
4. **[MLOps and Deployment](./04_mlops_and_deployment/)**: Techniques and tools for packaging, serving, monitoring, and explaining machine learning models in a real-world, production environment.
5.  **[Methodology](./05_methodology/)**: A step-by-step implementation framework for executing data science projects, based on the Foundational Methodology for Data Science by **John B. Rollins**.
