# Kocyigit-ML
Kocyigit-ML is an evolving project that consolidates the learning resources I use on my journey to becoming a Machine Learning Engineer. The project is structured into three key sections: Theory, practice, and methodology.

The roadmap for the theory and practice sections is heavily inspired by AssemblyAI's [recommendations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtolixa9XTg).

The methodology section is an attempt to turn *John B. Rollins’s 10-Stage Foundational Methodology for Data Science* into a a systematic approach to real-world ML projects.

This project serves as both a personal knowledge base and a resource for others navigating the ML landscape. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Content and Status
