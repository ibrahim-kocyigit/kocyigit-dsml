# Kocyigit-ML 🤖 
#### A structured learning repository for mastering Machine Learning fundamentals!

This project consolidates my curated learning resources, organized into three pillars: 

1. **[Theory](./01_theory/)**: Mathematical foundations (calculus, linear algebra, statistics and probability)  
2. **[Application](./02_application/)**: Applied skills (Python, libraries for data science and machine learning)  
3. **[Methodology](./03_methodology/)**: Implementation framework

The **Theory** and **Application** sections align with **AssemblyAI**'s [recommended roadmap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtolixa9XTg), while the **Methodology** section implements **John B. Rollins**'s [Foundational Methodology for Data Science](./03_methodology/references/IBMOpenSource_FoundationalMethologyforDataScience.PDF) as a systematic framework for real-world ML projects.
